00:02:03.872 --> 00:02:06.953
Summoned to court to answer for
the crime of your bannerman,

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:08.834
Gregor Clegane, The Mountain.

00:02:10.184 --> 00:02:14.287
Arrive within a fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown.

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:20.250
Poor Ned Stark. Brave man,
terrible judgement.

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.025
Attacking him was stupid.

00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:36.914
Lannister...

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.912
don't act like fools.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.177
You're gonna say
something clever?

00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:51.326
Go on, say something clever.

00:02:54.764 --> 00:02:56.876
Catelyn Stark took my brother.

00:03:00.828 --> 00:03:02.440
Why is he still alive?

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:03.664
Tyrion?

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.226
Ned Stark.

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:08.366
One of our men interfered...

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:11.777
speared him through the leg,
before I could finish him.

00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:14.337
Why is he still alive?

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:17.630
It wouldn't have been clean.

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:18.953
Clean?

00:03:20.642 --> 00:03:24.429
You spent too much time
worrying about what other people think of you.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.828
I could care less what
what anyone thinks of me.

00:03:26.866 --> 00:03:29.601
That's what you want people
to think of you.

00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:31.054
It's the truth.

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:37.129
And you hear them whispering "Kingslayer"
behind your back, doesn't it bother you?

00:03:39.267 --> 00:03:41.477
Of course it bothers me.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.667
A lion doesn't concern himself
with the opinion of a sheep.

00:03:48.604 --> 00:03:50.955
I suppose I should be grateful
that your varity,

00:03:50.956 --> 00:03:53.606
got in a way of your reckelessnes.

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.480
I'm giving you half of our forces.
30.000 men.

00:04:00.328 --> 00:04:03.422
And we'll bring that to
Catelyn Stark girlhood home...

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.542
and remind her that Lannisters
pay their debts

00:04:09.078 --> 00:04:12.656
I didn't realize you place such
a high value on my brother's life.

00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:14.227
He's a Lannister.

00:04:14.956 --> 00:04:18.278
Maybe the lowest of the Lannister,
but he's one of us.

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:20.842
And everyday that he remain a prisoner

00:04:20.964 --> 00:04:23.606
the less our name command respect.

00:04:23.952 --> 00:04:28.478
- So the lion does concern himself with the opinion...
- No, that's not an opinion, it's a fact.

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:33.509
If another house can seize
one of our own

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:35.856
and hold him captive, with impunity...

00:04:36.357 --> 00:04:38.992
we are no longer house to be feared.

00:04:43.268 --> 00:04:44.541
Your mother is dead.

00:04:45.454 --> 00:04:47.528
Before long I'll be dead.

00:04:47.563 --> 00:04:48.728
and you...

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:50.290
and your brother...

00:04:50.578 --> 00:04:53.167
and your sister and all of her children...

00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:57.419
all of us dead,
all of us rotting underground.

00:04:58.455 --> 00:05:01.104
Is the family name
that lives on.

00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:03.341
It's all that lives on.

00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:08.233
Not your personal glory
not your honor... but family.

00:05:09.644 --> 00:05:11.591
You understand?

00:05:23.395 --> 00:05:26.994
You're blessed with ability
that few men possess.

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:31.009
You're blessed you belong to
the most powerful family in the kingdom.

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:33.819
And you still blessed
with youth.

00:05:34.393 --> 00:05:36.893
And what you've done
with this blessing?

00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:41.708
You served as the glorified bodyguard
for two kings..

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:44.731
One a mad man, the other are drunk.

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:53.959
The future of our family will be
determined in these next few months.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.546
We could established a dinasty
that would last a thousand years...

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.680
or we could collapse into nothing.
As the Targaryen's did.

00:06:04.643 --> 00:06:08.681
I need you to become a man
you're always meant to be.

00:06:09.252 --> 00:06:11.627
Not next year, not tomorrow...

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:13.877
Now.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.678
You're in pain.

00:06:51.092 --> 00:06:52.978
I've had worse, my lady.

00:06:54.152 --> 00:06:56.065
Perhaps it's time to go hoome.

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:58.466
The south doesn't seems to agree with you..

00:06:58.467 --> 00:07:01.041
I knwo the truth Jon Arryn died for..

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:03.817
Do you, lord Stark?

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.238
Is that why you called me here?
To pose me riddles?

00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:10.673
Has he done this before?

00:07:12.442 --> 00:07:13.979
Jaime would've killed him.

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:17.690
My brother's worth
a thousand of your friend.

00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:18.778
Your brother...

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.591
or your lover?

00:07:25.754 --> 00:07:28.913
Targaryens wed brothers and sisters
for 300 years..

00:07:28.914 --> 00:07:30.591
to keep bloodlines pure.

00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:33.355
Jaime and I are more than
brother and sister.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:35.441
We shared a womb.

00:07:35.442 --> 00:07:38.444
Came to this world together,
we belong together.

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:41.156
My son saw you with him.

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:50.157
- Do you love your children?
- With all my heart.

00:07:50.192 --> 00:07:53.335
- No more than I love mine.
- And they're all Jaime's.

00:07:53.395 --> 00:07:54.609
Thank the Gods.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.126
In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,

00:07:58.127 --> 00:07:59.950
I finished him off another ways

00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:03.193
- In the morning he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

00:08:03.343 --> 00:08:04.549
Hated him?

00:08:05.098 --> 00:08:06.567
I worshipped him.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.706
Every girl in the southern kingdom
dreamt of him but he was mine by oath.

00:08:11.094 --> 00:08:14.930
And when I finally saw him on our wedding day
in the Sept of Baelor.

00:08:15.031 --> 00:08:19.556
lean and fierce, and black beared
it was the happiest moment of my life.

00:08:20.906 --> 00:08:23.280
And that night he crawl on top of me,
stinking of wine

00:08:23.315 --> 00:08:26.399
and did what he did what little he could do

00:08:28.182 --> 00:08:30.492
and whispered in my ear : "Lyanna".

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.240
Your sister was a corpse
and I was a living girl

00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:37.032
and he loved her more than me.

00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:42.530
When the king return from his hunts,
I'll tell him the truth.

00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:45.657
You must be gone by then...
you and your children.

00:08:45.777 --> 00:08:48.220
I will not have that blood on my hands.

00:08:48.513 --> 00:08:50.488
Go as far away as you can..

00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:53.312
With as many men as you can.

00:08:53.717 --> 00:08:55.163
Because wherever you go...

00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:57.914
Robert's wrath will follow you.

00:08:58.512 --> 00:09:00.426
And what of my wrath, lord Stark?

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:03.300
You should have taken the realm
for yourself.

00:09:03.515 --> 00:09:06.589
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:09.351
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.840
All you needed to do is claim the step
yourself. Such a sad mistake.

00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:17.217
I've made many mistakes in my life..

00:09:18.253 --> 00:09:20.042
but that wasn't one of them.

00:09:20.066 --> 00:09:21.442
Oh, but it was.

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:26.230
When you play the game of thrones,
you win or you die.

00:09:27.315 --> 00:09:28.843
There is no middle ground.

00:10:16.942 --> 00:10:19.766
No, No, No, No..

00:10:21.218 --> 00:10:23.634
is that what they teach you
up in the North?

00:10:25.156 --> 00:10:28.119
And you, wherever you're from.

00:10:29.093 --> 00:10:32.744
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:36.244
Either of you understand the thing that I'm saying?

00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:38.496
Yes, my lord.

00:10:39.344 --> 00:10:41.869
Lets start over. Shall we?

00:10:42.967 --> 00:10:46.558
You be the man, and you be the woman.

00:10:51.594 --> 00:10:52.908
Go ahead.

00:10:55.468 --> 00:10:56.844
Slowly.

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:10.932
You're not fooling them,
they just paid you, they know what you are.

00:11:11.469 --> 00:11:13.684
They know its all just an act

00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:16.744
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

00:11:17.044 --> 00:11:18.493
And that takes time.

00:11:19.533 --> 00:11:20.850
You need to..

00:11:21.388 --> 00:11:23.746
ease into it.

00:11:26.094 --> 00:11:27.370
Go ahead.

00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:31.058
Ease into it.

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:43.121
He's winding you over,
inspite of yourself.

00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:45.434
You starting to like this.

00:11:46.533 --> 00:11:48.005
He wants to believe you.

00:11:48.094 --> 00:11:50.673
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough

00:11:50.674 --> 00:11:52.058
to play with a boy, shouldn't you?

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.531
He knows, he's better than other men.

00:11:55.532 --> 00:11:59.245
He's always known it deep down inside
now he has proof.

00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:00.822
He's so good...

00:12:01.823 --> 00:12:06.309
he's reaching something deep inside of you
that no one even knew was there.

00:12:06.597 --> 00:12:09.247
Overcoming your very nature..

00:12:11.348 --> 00:12:13.636
Why don't you join us, my lord?

00:12:14.908 --> 00:12:17.134
I'm saving myself for another.

00:12:17.996 --> 00:12:19.843
What she doesn't know
will not hurt her?

00:12:19.844 --> 00:12:21.323
A stupid saying..

00:12:22.095 --> 00:12:25.734
What we don't know is usually
what get us killed.

00:12:26.722 --> 00:12:28.434
She must be very beautiful.

00:12:28.473 --> 00:12:32.398
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines, though.

00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:34.371
I do believe my lord in love.

00:12:34.409 --> 00:12:37.634
For many years.
Most of my life really.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.600
Play with her ass.

00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:41.401
And she loved me too.

00:12:42.202 --> 00:12:44.202
I was her little confidant.

00:12:45.203 --> 00:12:49.003
A play thing. She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

00:12:49.404 --> 00:12:53.604
She told me about
all the horses that she liked.

00:12:53.605 --> 00:12:58.005
The castle that she want to live in.
The man that she wanted to marry.

00:12:58.707 --> 00:13:00.207
A northener..

00:13:00.608 --> 00:13:02.608
with a jaw like an anvil.

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:07.908
So I challenged him to a duel. I mean,
why not? I'd read all the stories.

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:12.500
The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.

00:13:12.592 --> 00:13:16.400
In the end...
she wouldn't even let him kill me.

00:13:16.601 --> 00:13:19.101
"He's just a boy", she said.

00:13:19.402 --> 00:13:21.202
"Please don't hurt him".

00:13:21.903 --> 00:13:26.203
So he gave me a nice little scar to remember
and by enough they went

00:13:26.204 --> 00:13:28.704
- And she still married to him?
- Oh, no.

00:13:28.905 --> 00:13:31.605
He got himself killed before the wedding.

00:13:32.906 --> 00:13:37.006
And she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive spciment.

00:13:37.307 --> 00:13:39.607
She love him, I'm afraid.

00:13:39.908 --> 00:13:41.508
And why wouldn't she, I mean?

00:13:41.608 --> 00:13:45.008
Who could compare to him,
he just so...

00:13:51.603 --> 00:13:52.703
good.

00:13:55.304 --> 00:13:58.204
Do you know what I learned
losing that duel?

00:13:58.705 --> 00:14:00.605
I learned that I'll never win.

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:03.906
Not that way.
That's their game.

00:14:04.507 --> 00:14:06.007
Their rules.

00:14:06.908 --> 00:14:08.808
I'm not going to fight them.

00:14:09.109 --> 00:14:10.409
I'm going to fuck them.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.110
That's what I know, that's what I am.

00:14:14.611 --> 00:14:18.211
And only by admitting what we are,
can we get what we want.

00:14:19.212 --> 00:14:20.612
And what do you want?

00:14:21.513 --> 00:14:24.113
Oh, everything, my dear.

00:14:24.714 --> 00:14:26.314
Everything there is.

00:14:29.615 --> 00:14:32.815
Now wash yourself,
both of you are working tonight.

00:15:03.524 --> 00:15:05.851
You're very lucky girl,
do you know that?

00:15:09.459 --> 00:15:12.570
Where I come from we don't show mercy
to criminals.

00:15:12.738 --> 00:15:16.332
Where I come from,
if someone like you attacked a little lord..

00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:19.992
the low tide will lay you on your back,
on the beach..

00:15:20.161 --> 00:15:22.732
your hands and feet chained to four stakes..

00:15:23.206 --> 00:15:25.712
sea will coming cloaser and closer.

00:15:26.234 --> 00:15:30.222
You'll see death creeping toward you,
a few inches at a time.

00:15:31.622 --> 00:15:32.985
Where do you come from?

00:15:33.615 --> 00:15:35.061
The Iron Islands.

00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:37.099
They far away?

00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:39.429
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

00:15:39.464 --> 00:15:43.281
Trust me, you've never heard
where I'm from neither.

00:15:44.349 --> 00:15:46.509
Trust me, my lord.

00:15:49.471 --> 00:15:51.696
You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

00:15:51.872 --> 00:15:55.836
In civilised land, you advert
your betters by their proper titles.

00:15:56.432 --> 00:15:57.672
And what's that?

00:15:58.092 --> 00:15:59.172
Lord.

00:15:59.655 --> 00:16:00.783
Why?

00:16:02.082 --> 00:16:03.074
Why?

00:16:03.868 --> 00:16:05.643
What do you mean "why"?

00:16:05.859 --> 00:16:08.986
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
lord of the Iron Islands.

00:16:09.061 --> 00:16:10.955
What's that got to do with you?

00:16:12.175 --> 00:16:16.111
Your father's lord,
how can you be lord too?

00:16:16.802 --> 00:16:20.353
- I will be lord after my father..
- So you're not lord now.

00:16:20.372 --> 00:16:21.469
No, you...

00:16:23.786 --> 00:16:25.596
You having a go at me?

00:16:25.795 --> 00:16:26.795
Is that it?

00:16:27.472 --> 00:16:30.324
Just don't understand
how you southerner do things.

00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:31.654
I'm not a southerner.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.906
You're from south of The Wall...

00:16:34.507 --> 00:16:36.707
that make you southerner to me.

00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:41.872
You're an impudent little wench,
aren't you?

00:16:42.746 --> 00:16:46.542
Couldn't say, my lord.
Didn't know what impunent means.

00:16:46.808 --> 00:16:50.040
Impudent. It means rude.

00:16:50.694 --> 00:16:52.011
Disrespectful.

00:16:56.239 --> 00:16:58.171
Do you want to loose that chain?

00:17:00.712 --> 00:17:02.346
Theon Greyjoy!

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.570
The lady is our guest.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:07.148
Thought she was our prisoner.

00:17:07.212 --> 00:17:10.856
Are the two mutually exclusive,
in your experience?

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.419
Chances are I won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

00:17:24.422 --> 00:17:26.658
I'm used to worst than him.

00:17:27.509 --> 00:17:30.410
I'm used to men
that can chew that boy up.

00:17:30.445 --> 00:17:32.784
And pick their teeth with his bones.

00:17:39.109 --> 00:17:40.521
Why did you come here?

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.859
Didn't mean to come here.

00:17:43.541 --> 00:17:48.217
Meant to get much further south
than this. As far as south as south goes.

00:17:49.035 --> 00:17:51.216
Before the long night comes.

00:17:51.727 --> 00:17:52.782
Why?

00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:54.381
What do you afraid of?

00:17:55.294 --> 00:17:59.392
Those thing that sleep in the day
and hunt at night

00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:04.015
- Owl and shadowcats...
- I'm not talking about owl and shadowcats.

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:10.422
The thing you speak of..

00:18:11.295 --> 00:18:13.805
have been gone for thousand of years.

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:15.794
It wasn't gone, old man.

00:18:17.395 --> 00:18:18.995
They were sleeping.

00:18:20.115 --> 00:18:22.581
And they're sleeping no more.

00:18:31.358 --> 00:18:32.993
I missed girls.

00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:36.800
Not even talking to them,
I never talk to them.

00:18:38.747 --> 00:18:40.397
Just lookin' at them.

00:18:40.618 --> 00:18:42.081
Hearing them giggle.

00:18:47.857 --> 00:18:49.574
Don't you missed girls?

00:18:54.918 --> 00:18:56.006
Riders!

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.739
The horn. We have to blow the horn.

00:19:00.754 --> 00:19:01.906
Why is he alone?

00:19:04.641 --> 00:19:07.010
One blast for a ranger returning

00:19:07.357 --> 00:19:08.794
Two for wildlings

00:19:09.233 --> 00:19:11.644
- Three..
- He's no rider.

00:19:45.849 --> 00:19:47.941
That's my uncle Benjen rode..

00:19:55.409 --> 00:19:56.610
where's my uncle?

00:20:00.941 --> 00:20:01.943
Ned!

00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:05.718
Robert...

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.721
we are hunting... a boar...

00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:18.595
I should have spent more time with you.

00:20:19.607 --> 00:20:22.180
Shown to you how to be a man.

00:20:25.753 --> 00:20:28.402
I was never meant to be a father.

00:20:48.424 --> 00:20:49.432
Go on....

00:20:50.607 --> 00:20:52.470
you don't want to see this.

00:21:06.855 --> 00:21:08.114
My fault..

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.381
Too much wine..

00:21:11.002 --> 00:21:13.070
Missed my thrust..

00:21:21.981 --> 00:21:23.820
Stinks.

00:21:24.769 --> 00:21:26.652
Stinks like death.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.042
Don't think I can't smell it.

00:21:33.302 --> 00:21:36.167
Pay the bastard back, Ned.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.056
I drove my knife
right through his brain

00:21:39.057 --> 00:21:41.317
You ask him if I didn't. Ask him!

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:47.886
I want the funeral feast to be the biggest
the kingdom ever saw..

00:21:48.953 --> 00:21:52.741
And I want everyone
to taste the boar that got me

00:21:56.166 --> 00:21:59.594
Now leave us, the lot of you
I need to talk to Ned.

00:22:00.329 --> 00:22:03.291
- Robert, my sweet...
- Out! All of you!

00:22:22.972 --> 00:22:24.783
You damn fool.

00:22:25.363 --> 00:22:27.400
Paper and ink. On the table.

00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:29.301
Write down what I said.

00:22:37.307 --> 00:22:40.819
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.520
First of... you know how it goes.
Put in the damn titles..

00:22:47.436 --> 00:22:48.927
I hereby command..

00:22:49.328 --> 00:22:54.028
Eddard of House Stark...
titles..titles...

00:22:55.038 --> 00:23:00.052
to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of The Realm, upon my death..

00:23:00.787 --> 00:23:03.187
to rule in my stead..

00:23:03.786 --> 00:23:07.286
until my son Joffrey comes of age.

00:23:24.918 --> 00:23:25.974
Give it over..

00:23:42.002 --> 00:23:43.567
Give it to the council..

00:23:44.068 --> 00:23:45.568
after I'm death.

00:23:47.175 --> 00:23:51.729
At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.

00:23:51.926 --> 00:23:53.812
You'll rule now.

00:23:54.962 --> 00:23:57.425
You'll hate it worse than I did..

00:23:58.365 --> 00:23:59.810
but you'll do it well.

00:24:04.297 --> 00:24:05.535
The girl..

00:24:06.536 --> 00:24:07.836
Daenerys...

00:24:09.937 --> 00:24:11.237
you're right.

00:24:11.324 --> 00:24:15.423
Varys, Littlefinger, my brother..
Worthless..

00:24:16.301 --> 00:24:18.476
Noone to tell me "No" but you.

00:24:20.777 --> 00:24:21.777
Only you.

00:24:26.152 --> 00:24:27.603
Let her live

00:24:29.404 --> 00:24:32.604
- Stop it if its not to late.
- I will.

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:34.910
My son...

00:24:36.511 --> 00:24:38.111
help him, Ned.

00:24:39.547 --> 00:24:41.459
Make him better than me

00:24:42.509 --> 00:24:43.619
I'll...

00:24:45.482 --> 00:24:48.450
I'll do everything I can
to honor your memory.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.216
My memory?

00:24:53.449 --> 00:24:56.087
King Robert Baratheon...

00:24:56.988 --> 00:24:59.388
murdered by a pig.

00:25:02.963 --> 00:25:06.312
Give me something to the pain,
and let me die.

00:25:21.074 --> 00:25:22.948
Give him milk of the poppy.

00:25:31.168 --> 00:25:33.861
He was reeling from the wine..

00:25:35.147 --> 00:25:36.525
He commanded us to...

00:25:36.926 --> 00:25:38.626
step aside, but...

00:25:39.973 --> 00:25:41.383
I failed him.

00:25:44.074 --> 00:25:47.026
No men could've protected him from himself.

00:25:48.674 --> 00:25:53.801
I wonder, Ser Barristan,
who gave the King this wine?

00:25:54.736 --> 00:25:57.611
His squire.
From the King's own skin.

00:25:57.696 --> 00:26:00.625
His squire? The Lannister boy?

00:26:00.947 --> 00:26:05.466
Such a dutiful boy to make sure
His Grace did not lack refreshment.

00:26:06.148 --> 00:26:09.584
I do hope the poor lad
is not blame himself.

00:26:17.575 --> 00:26:21.997
His Grace has had a change of heart
concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.387
Whatever arrangements you made...

00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:30.418
unmade them, at once.

00:26:30.505 --> 00:26:33.810
I'm afraid those birds have flown.

00:26:34.024 --> 00:26:36.419
The Khaleesi likely dead already.

00:28:17.123 --> 00:28:19.351
Can you help me make him.. understand?

00:28:19.445 --> 00:28:22.186
The Dothraki do things on their own time
for their own reason

00:28:22.201 --> 00:28:25.809
Have patience, Khaleesi. We will
go home, I promise you.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.111
My brother...

00:28:27.312 --> 00:28:31.312
was a fool, I know.. but he was
the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.

00:28:32.672 --> 00:28:34.292
Have I said something funny, ser?

00:28:34.327 --> 00:28:37.316
Forgive me, khaleesi, but your ancestor,
Aegon The Conqueror,

00:28:37.317 --> 00:28:40.048
didn't seize six of the kingdoms
because it his right.

00:28:40.083 --> 00:28:42.780
He have no right to them,
he seized them because he could.

00:28:42.892 --> 00:28:44.588
And because he had dragons.

00:28:44.893 --> 00:28:47.495
Having few dragons makes things easier.

00:28:48.333 --> 00:28:51.822
- You don't believe it?
- Have you ever seen a dragon, khaleesi?

00:28:52.256 --> 00:28:55.008
I believe what my eyes and ears report.

00:28:55.307 --> 00:28:59.556
As for the rest, it was 300 years ago,
who knows what really happened.

00:28:59.616 --> 00:29:01.965
Now if you pardon me,
I'll seek out the merchant captain..

00:29:01.966 --> 00:29:04.966
- see if he has any letter for me.
- Well, I'll come with you.

00:29:04.984 --> 00:29:06.692
No, no, don't trouble yourself.

00:29:06.788 --> 00:29:10.029
Enjoy the market.
I'll rejoin you soon enough.

00:29:18.714 --> 00:29:20.441
Jorah, the Andal?

00:29:22.653 --> 00:29:26.552
The Spider sent his greetings
and his congratulations.

00:29:29.129 --> 00:29:30.665
Overall pardon,

00:29:30.918 --> 00:29:32.517
you can go home now.

00:30:12.564 --> 00:30:16.953
My son already has his name, but I'll
try your summer wine. Just a taste.

00:30:17.875 --> 00:30:20.160
My lady, you are from Westeros?

00:30:20.315 --> 00:30:23.976
You have the honor of addressing
Daenerys of the House Targaryen.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:28.086
Khaleesi of the riding men,
and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

00:30:28.576 --> 00:30:30.599
- Princess.
- Rise.

00:30:31.188 --> 00:30:33.076
I still like to taste that wine.

00:30:33.654 --> 00:30:34.713
That?

00:30:35.314 --> 00:30:38.714
Dorne's sweet not worthy of a princess.

00:30:38.828 --> 00:30:41.115
I have the dry red from the Arbor.

00:30:41.305 --> 00:30:42.850
Nectar of the Gods.

00:30:43.281 --> 00:30:45.039
Let me give you a cask.

00:30:45.402 --> 00:30:47.866
- A gift!
- You honor me, ser.

00:30:47.877 --> 00:30:50.329
The honor.. the honor is all mine.

00:30:55.592 --> 00:30:57.296
You know there are many in your homeland

00:30:57.297 --> 00:30:58.954
that pray for your return, princess.

00:30:58.989 --> 00:31:00.952
I hope to repay your kindness someday.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.231
The wine is for the Khaleesi,
it's not for the likes of you.

00:31:13.278 --> 00:31:14.338
Open it.

00:31:26.162 --> 00:31:27.161
Pour.

00:31:28.055 --> 00:31:31.462
It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich
without at least giving it time to breathe.

00:31:31.464 --> 00:31:32.851
Do as he says.

00:31:34.254 --> 00:31:35.953
As the princess command.

00:31:48.272 --> 00:31:49.765
Sweet, isn't it?

00:31:50.815 --> 00:31:52.572
Can you smell the fruit, ser?

00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:55.314
Taste it, my lord.

00:31:55.902 --> 00:31:59.585
Tell me that is not the finest wine
that has ever touch your tongue.

00:32:02.939 --> 00:32:04.205
You first.

00:32:06.844 --> 00:32:07.953
Me?

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.002
I'm afraid I'm not worthy of the vintage.

00:32:11.052 --> 00:32:14.099
Beside, is it a poor wine merchant
who drink up his own wares

00:32:14.148 --> 00:32:16.639
You will drink.

00:32:48.687 --> 00:32:49.727
Come.

00:32:56.964 --> 00:32:59.860
You came to us as outlaws..

00:33:00.138 --> 00:33:01.563
poachers..

00:33:02.175 --> 00:33:03.198
rapers..

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.552
killers, thieves...

00:33:05.677 --> 00:33:07.122
You came alone..

00:33:07.522 --> 00:33:09.001
in chains..

00:33:09.501 --> 00:33:12.584
without friends, or honor.

00:33:13.323 --> 00:33:15.111
You came to us rich..

00:33:15.588 --> 00:33:17.178
or you came to us poor.

00:33:17.673 --> 00:33:21.748
Some of you bear the name
of proud houses..

00:33:22.299 --> 00:33:25.290
all those only bastard names,
or no names at all.

00:33:25.389 --> 00:33:30.525
It does not matter.
All that, is in the past.

00:33:31.045 --> 00:33:32.129
Here..

00:33:33.113 --> 00:33:34.577
on the Wall.

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:37.777
we're all one house.

00:33:38.949 --> 00:33:40.095
Tonight..

00:33:40.806 --> 00:33:42.977
We're allowed to look happy..

00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:45.073
you're going to be a ranger.

00:33:46.363 --> 00:33:48.372
It's not what you always wanted?

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:50.764
I want to find my uncle.

00:33:51.886 --> 00:33:55.187
I know he's alive out there.
I know he is.

00:33:56.426 --> 00:33:59.613
I wish I could help you,
but I'm no ranger.

00:34:00.328 --> 00:34:02.439
its the steward's life for me.

00:34:03.287 --> 00:34:05.379
You're honored being a steward.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.701
Not much, really.

00:34:08.085 --> 00:34:09.627
But those food.

00:34:14.985 --> 00:34:17.028
You begin a new.

00:34:23.983 --> 00:34:27.674
A man of the Night's Watch.

00:34:29.117 --> 00:34:31.808
live his life for the realm.

00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:35.062
Not for King

00:34:35.492 --> 00:34:36.671
or a Lord..

00:34:36.862 --> 00:34:40.523
or the honor of this house or that house.

00:34:41.015 --> 00:34:43.566
Not for gold, glory,..

00:34:43.702 --> 00:34:45.528
or women's love.

00:34:46.446 --> 00:34:47.848
But for the realm..

00:34:48.295 --> 00:34:50.526
and all the people in it.

00:34:51.363 --> 00:34:55.104
You all learned the words, your vow

00:34:55.202 --> 00:34:58.128
Think carefully before you say them.

00:34:58.794 --> 00:35:00.915
The penalty for desertion..

00:35:01.676 --> 00:35:03.038
is death.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.690
You can take your vows here..

00:35:10.919 --> 00:35:12.119
tonight..

00:35:12.703 --> 00:35:13.794
at sunset.

00:35:15.097 --> 00:35:17.665
Do any of you still keep the Old Gods?

00:35:19.733 --> 00:35:21.238
I do, my lord.

00:35:21.642 --> 00:35:25.085
Do you want to take your vows before the heart tree,
as your uncle did?

00:35:25.151 --> 00:35:26.212
Yes, my lord.

00:35:26.322 --> 00:35:29.270
You'll find the weirwoods,
a mile north of the Wall..

00:35:29.362 --> 00:35:31.421
and your Old  Gods too, maybe.

00:35:33.173 --> 00:35:34.302
My Lord?

00:35:35.172 --> 00:35:36.387
Might I go as well?

00:35:36.414 --> 00:35:38.699
Is House Tarly keep the Old Gods?

00:35:38.933 --> 00:35:40.339
No, my lord..

00:35:41.085 --> 00:35:43.303
I was name in the light of the Seven..

00:35:43.404 --> 00:35:46.104
as my father was
and his father before him.

00:35:46.214 --> 00:35:49.840
Why would you forsake,
the Gods of your father and your house?

00:35:52.257 --> 00:35:54.887
The Night's Watch is my house now.

00:35:54.894 --> 00:35:57.574
The Seven have never answer my prayers..

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.061
perhaps the Old Gods will.

00:36:01.586 --> 00:36:02.836
As you wish.

00:36:04.214 --> 00:36:07.050
You all been,
assigned an order..

00:36:07.322 --> 00:36:09.636
according to our needs..

00:36:10.237 --> 00:36:12.337
and your strength.

00:36:12.411 --> 00:36:14.597
Halder, builders.

00:36:15.588 --> 00:36:17.287
Pyp, to the stewards.

00:36:17.434 --> 00:36:18.753
Tod, to the builders.

00:36:19.051 --> 00:36:20.402
Grenn, to the rangers.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:22.000
Samwell, to the stewards.

00:36:22.713 --> 00:36:25.653
Matthar, to the rangers.
Dareon, to the stewards.

00:36:26.159 --> 00:36:27.940
Ballion, to the rangers

00:36:28.263 --> 00:36:29.817
Rast, to the rangers

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.667
Jon, to the stewards.

00:36:31.878 --> 00:36:33.221
Lancel, to the builders.

00:36:33.508 --> 00:36:36.387
Ihyll, to the builders.
Gordor, to the stewards.

00:36:36.525 --> 00:36:39.689
Nikko, to the rangers.
Eskan, to the rangers.

00:36:39.999 --> 00:36:42.877
Albett, to the builders,
Jorden to the stables.

00:36:43.175 --> 00:36:44.486
Mikken, to the cooks.

00:36:44.713 --> 00:36:46.270
Halor, to the builders.

00:36:46.424 --> 00:36:48.751
Delugo, to the rangers.

00:36:49.007 --> 00:36:51.877
May all the Gods preserve you.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.639
Rangers, with me.

00:37:00.568 --> 00:37:01.712
Builders!

00:37:21.322 --> 00:37:22.411
Samwell...

00:37:22.738 --> 00:37:25.737
you will assisst me in the rookery
and the library.

00:37:25.992 --> 00:37:26.989
Pyp...

00:37:27.135 --> 00:37:30.064
you will report to Bowen Marsh,
in the kitchen.

00:37:30.187 --> 00:37:34.229
Luke, report to One Eye Joe in the stable..

00:37:34.958 --> 00:37:38.647
Dareon, I'm sending you to the east watch..

00:37:38.825 --> 00:37:41.539
present yourself to Borcas when you arrive..

00:37:41.697 --> 00:37:45.046
Make no comment about his nose.

00:37:46.584 --> 00:37:47.609
Jon Snow...

00:37:47.826 --> 00:37:52.026
Lord Commander Mormont has requested you
for his personal steward.

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.151
Will I serve the Lord Commander's meal,

00:37:55.152 --> 00:37:57.140
and fetch hot water for his bath?

00:37:57.175 --> 00:37:58.173
Certainly.

00:37:58.374 --> 00:38:00.874
And keep the fire burning in his chambers..

00:38:00.875 --> 00:38:03.675
change his sheets
and blankets daily..

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:07.563
and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.

00:38:10.591 --> 00:38:12.124
You take me for a servant?

00:38:12.222 --> 00:38:15.145
We took you for a man of the Night's Watch.

00:38:15.237 --> 00:38:18.085
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

00:38:18.738 --> 00:38:20.013
May I go?

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.714
As you wish.

00:38:27.436 --> 00:38:29.746
Jon! Wait!

00:38:29.875 --> 00:38:33.455
- Don't you see what they're doing?
- I see ser Alliser revenge thats all..

00:38:33.456 --> 00:38:35.255
he wanted it and he got it.

00:38:35.289 --> 00:38:37.519
Steward are nothing
but maid!

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.194
I'm a better swordman and rider than any of you!

00:38:40.293 --> 00:38:41.650
It's not fair!

00:38:41.728 --> 00:38:43.296
Fair?

00:38:43.813 --> 00:38:45.908
I was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall,

00:38:45.909 --> 00:38:48.822
when he put his hand in my leg
and he wanted to see my cock.

00:38:48.902 --> 00:38:50.393
I pushed him away and he said..

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:52.935
he'd have my hand cut off
for stealing when he's over.

00:38:52.936 --> 00:38:54.875
So now I'm here,
at the end of the world,

00:38:54.876 --> 00:38:57.825
where noone to sing a folk,
but old men and little shit like you.

00:38:57.826 --> 00:38:59.753
I'll never see my family again.

00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:03.198
I'll never been inside a women again.
Don't tell me about fair.

00:39:03.199 --> 00:39:05.224
I thought you were caught stealing
a wheel of cheese..

00:39:05.225 --> 00:39:07.112
for your starving sister.

00:39:07.147 --> 00:39:09.200
Course who's gonna teel a bunch of strangers..

00:39:09.201 --> 00:39:11.404
a high lord try to grab my cock?

00:39:13.754 --> 00:39:15.744
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?

00:39:15.994 --> 00:39:18.064
I'd like to hear a song.

00:39:22.584 --> 00:39:23.864
Now listen to me..

00:39:24.323 --> 00:39:27.617
the old man, is the Lord Commander
of The Night's Watch.

00:39:27.669 --> 00:39:32.313
You will be with him, day and night,
yes.. you will clean his clothes.

00:39:32.314 --> 00:39:34.670
You will also, take his letters..

00:39:34.671 --> 00:39:37.944
attend him at meeting,
squire for him at battle.

00:39:38.134 --> 00:39:41.503
You'll know everything,
be part of everything.

00:39:41.704 --> 00:39:44.154
And he ask for you himself.

00:39:44.814 --> 00:39:47.713
He wants to groom you for command.

00:39:52.893 --> 00:39:53.990
I just...

00:39:55.306 --> 00:39:57.513
I always wanted to be a ranger.

00:39:59.722 --> 00:40:01.772
I always wanted to be a wizard.

00:40:05.093 --> 00:40:06.383
What?

00:40:06.742 --> 00:40:08.252
No, I'm serious.

00:40:08.253 --> 00:40:11.063
So you'll stay and say your word with me?

00:40:17.513 --> 00:40:18.862
Lord Stark.

00:40:19.412 --> 00:40:20.752
A moment?

00:40:21.902 --> 00:40:23.542
Alone, if you will.

00:40:33.402 --> 00:40:35.542
He name you Protector of The Realm.

00:40:37.182 --> 00:40:38.362
He did.

00:40:38.881 --> 00:40:40.342
She won't care.

00:40:40.422 --> 00:40:43.382
Give me an hour and I'll put
a hundred of swords at your command.

00:40:44.152 --> 00:40:47.411
- And what should I do with a hundred swords?
- Strike!

00:40:47.412 --> 00:40:49.921
Tonight, while the castle sleeps.

00:40:50.112 --> 00:40:53.391
We must get Joffrey away from his mother
and into our custody.

00:40:53.401 --> 00:40:57.331
Protector of The Realm or no,
he who holds the king holds the kingdom.

00:40:58.322 --> 00:41:01.620
Every moment you delay,
gives Cersei another moment to prepare.

00:41:01.621 --> 00:41:04.513
By the time Robert die,
it would be late for the both of us.

00:41:04.548 --> 00:41:06.161
What about Stannis?

00:41:06.221 --> 00:41:10.111
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
and delivering him to Stannis?

00:41:10.331 --> 00:41:12.700
You have odd notion about
"protecting the realm".

00:41:12.701 --> 00:41:14.370
Stannis is your older brother.

00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:16.911
This isn't about the bloody line of succession.

00:41:16.971 --> 00:41:18.874
That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King..

00:41:18.875 --> 00:41:21.592
it shouldn't matter now.

00:41:22.696 --> 00:41:24.726
What's the best for the kingdoms?

00:41:25.186 --> 00:41:27.695
What's best for the people we rule?

00:41:28.836 --> 00:41:31.146
We all know what Stannis is..

00:41:31.955 --> 00:41:34.576
He inspires no love, or loyalty.

00:41:35.015 --> 00:41:36.496
He's not a king.

00:41:38.026 --> 00:41:39.395
I am.

00:41:46.235 --> 00:41:48.025
Stannis is a commander.

00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:51.334
He's led men into war, twice.

00:41:51.335 --> 00:41:54.744
- He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
- Yes. he's a good soldier, everyone knows that.

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:56.435
so is Robert.

00:41:57.334 --> 00:42:01.345
Tell me something. Do you still believe
good soldier made good king?

00:42:06.905 --> 00:42:10.675
I will not dishonor Robert's last hour
by shedding blood in his house..

00:42:11.345 --> 00:42:14.214
and dragging frightened children,
from their beds.

00:42:27.664 --> 00:42:30.064
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.

00:42:30.284 --> 00:42:33.114
You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.

00:42:34.714 --> 00:42:36.244
Not his steward.

00:42:37.554 --> 00:42:39.504
Not his captain of the guard.

00:42:39.954 --> 00:42:41.623
And not his wife.

00:42:47.413 --> 00:42:49.394
Only Stannis himself.

00:42:50.813 --> 00:42:52.153
Yes, my lord.

00:42:54.324 --> 00:42:55.693
Now leave us.

00:43:05.353 --> 00:43:07.183
My lord protector.

00:43:13.153 --> 00:43:15.351
The king has no trueborn son.

00:43:15.898 --> 00:43:19.813
Joffrey and Tommen, are Jaime Lannister's bastards.

00:43:20.702 --> 00:43:25.075
- So when the king dies..
- The throne passes to his brother..

00:43:26.442 --> 00:43:28.023
Lord Stannis.

00:43:29.003 --> 00:43:30.783
So it would seem.

00:43:32.232 --> 00:43:34.851
- Unless..
- There is no "unless"!

00:43:34.852 --> 00:43:37.147
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

00:43:37.182 --> 00:43:39.412
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

00:43:39.413 --> 00:43:43.512
You would be wise to denied to him.
And to make sure Joffrey succeeds.

00:43:46.532 --> 00:43:48.552
Do you have a shred of honor?

00:43:49.122 --> 00:43:52.615
You're now Hand of The King
and Protector of The Realm,

00:43:52.616 --> 00:43:58.232
all the power is yours, you need only..
reach out and take it.

00:43:58.362 --> 00:44:01.571
Make peace with the Lannisters.
Release The Imp.

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:03.911
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

00:44:04.151 --> 00:44:06.195
We've plenty of time
to get rid of Stannis..

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:09.805
and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
when he come into his throne..

00:44:09.806 --> 00:44:12.319
we simply reveal his little secret..

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.216
- and sit Lord Renly there instead.
- We?

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:19.251
You'll need someone to share this burdens,
I assure you..

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.901
my price would be modest.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.911
Would you suggest this treason?

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.260
Only if we lose.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.040
Make peace with the Lannisters you say..

00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:36.068
The people who tried to murder my boy.

00:44:36.103 --> 00:44:41.861
We only make peace with our enemy, my lord.
That's why its called making peace.

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:43.330
No...

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:45.530
I won't do it.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:49.880
- So it will be Stannis? and war?
- There is no other choice.

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:52.470
He is the heir.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:57.370
So why did you call me here?
Not for my wisdom clearly.

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:01.000
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

00:45:01.159 --> 00:45:04.109
The queen had a dozen knights
and hundred man-at-arms.

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:07.650
Enough to overwhelm what remain
of my household guard.

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:10.439
I need the Gold Cloaks.

00:45:10.769 --> 00:45:13.330
The City Watch is two thousand strong.

00:45:13.759 --> 00:45:16.319
and sworn to defend the king's peace.

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:20.719
Look at you.

00:45:21.769 --> 00:45:25.839
You know what you want me to do.
You know it has to be done.

00:45:26.149 --> 00:45:28.449
But it's not honorable, so...

00:45:28.939 --> 00:45:31.159
the words stick in your throat.

00:45:31.639 --> 00:45:35.702
When the Queen proclaims one king,
and the Hand proclaim another..

00:45:35.703 --> 00:45:39.009
who's peace to the Gold Cloaks protect?

00:45:40.299 --> 00:45:42.168
Who do they follow?

00:45:47.099 --> 00:45:49.039
The man who pays them.

00:46:34.388 --> 00:46:38.758
Hear my words,
and bear witness to my vow

00:46:38.818 --> 00:46:42.278
Night gathers, and now my watch begins.

00:46:42.478 --> 00:46:45.326
It shall not end until my death.

00:46:45.688 --> 00:46:51.357
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.

00:46:51.688 --> 00:46:55.321
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.

00:46:55.587 --> 00:46:58.934
I shall live and die at my post.

00:46:59.077 --> 00:47:01.730
I am the sword in the darkness.

00:47:02.216 --> 00:47:04.637
I am the watcher on the walls.

00:47:04.946 --> 00:47:08.593
I am the shield that guards the realm of men.

00:47:08.986 --> 00:47:13.134
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,

00:47:13.135 --> 00:47:16.635
for this night and all the nights to come.

00:47:16.945 --> 00:47:18.876
You knelt as boys..

00:47:19.145 --> 00:47:21.955
rise now as men
of the Night's Watch.

00:47:35.043 --> 00:47:37.303
Welcome.. Welcome..

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:45.541
What he's got there?

00:47:45.778 --> 00:47:47.089
To me, Ghost.

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:48.850
Bring it here.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.499
Gods be good.

00:47:59.732 --> 00:48:01.202
What will they do to him?

00:48:04.832 --> 00:48:06.141
When the khalasar rides..

00:48:06.176 --> 00:48:10.635
he'll be leashed to the saddle and forced
to run behind the horses, as long as he can.

00:48:11.037 --> 00:48:12.492
And when he falls?

00:48:14.142 --> 00:48:16.892
I saw a man last nine miles once.

00:48:18.642 --> 00:48:20.583
King Robert still wants me dead.

00:48:20.618 --> 00:48:23.602
This poisoner was the first,
he won't be the last.

00:48:23.722 --> 00:48:27.221
I thought he'd leave me alone,
now that my brother is gone.

00:48:27.222 --> 00:48:29.561
He will never leave you alone.

00:48:30.272 --> 00:48:33.521
If you ride to Asshai,
his assassins will follow you.

00:48:33.522 --> 00:48:37.311
If you sail all the way to the Basilisk Isle,
his spy would tell him.

00:48:37.312 --> 00:48:40.071
He will never abandon the hunt.

00:48:40.912 --> 00:48:42.711
You are Targaryen.

00:48:42.882 --> 00:48:44.660
The last Targaryen.

00:48:44.661 --> 00:48:47.065
Your son will have Targaryen blood..

00:48:47.066 --> 00:48:49.421
with 40.000 riders behind him.

00:48:50.741 --> 00:48:52.491
He will not have my son.

00:48:53.721 --> 00:48:55.921
He will not have you either, khaleesi.

00:51:58.373 --> 00:51:59.743
Lord Stark!

00:52:00.303 --> 00:52:02.222
- Stop!
- It's alright.

00:52:02.552 --> 00:52:04.945
- It's alright. Let him through.
- Lord Stark...

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:07.533
King Joffrey and the queen regent
request you presence in the throne room.

00:52:07.534 --> 00:52:09.436
King Joffrey?

00:52:09.571 --> 00:52:12.723
King Robert is gone.
The Gods give him rest.

00:52:25.123 --> 00:52:27.616
All is accomplished.
The City Watch is youts.

00:52:27.617 --> 00:52:28.968
Good.

00:52:29.868 --> 00:52:31.847
Is Lord Renly joining us?

00:52:33.507 --> 00:52:37.057
I fear Lord Renly
has left the city.

00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:40.550
He rode through the Old Gate
an hour before dawn..

00:52:40.551 --> 00:52:44.707
with ser Loras Tyrell
and some fifty retainers.

00:52:44.717 --> 00:52:48.757
Last seen galloping south in some haste.

00:53:09.116 --> 00:53:11.067
We stand behind you, lord Stark.

00:53:20.536 --> 00:53:25.267
All hail His Grace,
Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister.

00:53:25.268 --> 00:53:26.739
The First of His Name,

00:53:27.056 --> 00:53:29.267
The King of The Andal, and The First Men..

00:53:29.426 --> 00:53:34.513
Lord of The Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of The Realm.

00:53:52.656 --> 00:53:56.824
I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.

00:53:56.825 --> 00:53:59.366
I wish to be crowned within the forthnight.

00:53:59.555 --> 00:54:04.375
Today I shall accept oaths of fealty
from my loyal councillors.

00:54:08.505 --> 00:54:09.845
Ser Barristan...

00:54:10.375 --> 00:54:14.175
I believe no men here
could ever question your honor.

00:54:24.666 --> 00:54:26.336
King Robert seal.

00:54:26.836 --> 00:54:27.926
Unbroken.

00:54:35.554 --> 00:54:38.585
Lord Eddard Stark is herein named..

00:54:38.984 --> 00:54:40.974
Protector of The Realm..

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:43.978
to rule as regent...

00:54:43.979 --> 00:54:46.770
until the heir come of age.

00:54:47.909 --> 00:54:50.269
May I see that letter, ser Barristan?

00:54:58.818 --> 00:55:00.609
Protector of The Realm.

00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:07.019
Is this meant to be your shield,
Lord Stark?

00:55:08.128 --> 00:55:09.798
A piece of paper.

00:55:13.259 --> 00:55:14.757
Those were the king's words.

00:55:14.758 --> 00:55:16.699
We have a new king now.

00:55:19.078 --> 00:55:23.008
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
you offer me some counsel.

00:55:23.148 --> 00:55:25.289
Allow me to return the courtesy.

00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:27.540
Bend the knee, my lord.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:31.240
Bend the knee
and swear loyalty to my son.

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.485
And we shall allow you to live out the days
in the grey waste..

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:37.111
you called home.

00:55:37.259 --> 00:55:39.798
Your son has no claim to the throne.

00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:40.566
Liar!

00:55:40.567 --> 00:55:43.531
You condemn yourself
with your own mouth, Lord Stark.

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:46.120
Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:50.609
Ser Barristan is a good man,
a loyal man, do him no harm.

00:55:53.059 --> 00:55:54.730
You think you stands alone?

00:55:57.648 --> 00:56:00.759
Kill him! Kill all of them.
I commanded.

00:56:01.048 --> 00:56:02.268
Commander!

00:56:02.738 --> 00:56:05.427
Take the queen and
her children to custody.

00:56:05.428 --> 00:56:09.317
Escort them back to the royal apartment
and keep them there under guard.

00:56:09.318 --> 00:56:10.758
Men of the watch!

00:56:15.248 --> 00:56:17.008
I want no bloodshed.

00:56:17.758 --> 00:56:21.998
Tell your men to lay down their swords,
noone needs to die.

00:56:24.288 --> 00:56:25.388
Now!

00:56:36.817 --> 00:56:39.718
I did warn you not to trust me.
