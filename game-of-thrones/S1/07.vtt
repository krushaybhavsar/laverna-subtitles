00:02:04.622 --> 00:02:07.703
Summoned to court to answer for
the crime of your bannerman,

00:02:07.704 --> 00:02:09.584
Gregor Clegane, The Mountain.

00:02:10.934 --> 00:02:15.037
Arrive within a fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:21.000
Poor Ned Stark. Brave man,
terrible judgement.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.775
Attacking him was stupid.

00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:37.664
Lannister...

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.662
don't act like fools.

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.927
You're gonna say
something clever?

00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:52.076
Go on, say something clever.

00:02:55.514 --> 00:02:57.626
Catelyn Stark took my brother.

00:03:01.578 --> 00:03:03.190
Why is he still alive?

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.414
Tyrion?

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.976
Ned Stark.

00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:09.116
One of our men interfered...

00:03:09.217 --> 00:03:12.527
speared him through the leg,
before I could finish him.

00:03:13.202 --> 00:03:15.087
Why is he still alive?

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:18.380
It wouldn't have been clean.

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:19.703
Clean?

00:03:21.392 --> 00:03:25.179
You spent too much time
worrying about what other people think of you.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.578
I could care less what
what anyone thinks of me.

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:30.351
That's what you want people
to think of you.

00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:31.804
It's the truth.

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:37.879
And you hear them whispering "Kingslayer"
behind your back, doesn't it bother you?

00:03:40.017 --> 00:03:42.227
Of course it bothers me.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.417
A lion doesn't concern himself
with the opinion of a sheep.

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.705
I suppose I should be grateful
that your varity,

00:03:51.706 --> 00:03:54.356
got in a way of your reckelessnes.

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.230
I'm giving you half of our forces.
30.000 men.

00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:04.172
And we'll bring that to
Catelyn Stark girlhood home...

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.292
and remind her that Lannisters
pay their debts

00:04:09.828 --> 00:04:13.406
I didn't realize you place such
a high value on my brother's life.

00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:14.977
He's a Lannister.

00:04:15.706 --> 00:04:19.028
Maybe the lowest of the Lannister,
but he's one of us.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.592
And everyday that he remain a prisoner

00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:24.356
the less our name command respect.

00:04:24.702 --> 00:04:29.228
- So the lion does concern himself with the opinion...
- No, that's not an opinion, it's a fact.

00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:34.259
If another house can seize
one of our own

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:36.606
and hold him captive, with impunity...

00:04:37.107 --> 00:04:39.742
we are no longer house to be feared.

00:04:44.018 --> 00:04:45.291
Your mother is dead.

00:04:46.204 --> 00:04:48.278
Before long I'll be dead.

00:04:48.313 --> 00:04:49.478
and you...

00:04:50.016 --> 00:04:51.040
and your brother...

00:04:51.328 --> 00:04:53.917
and your sister and all of her children...

00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:58.169
all of us dead,
all of us rotting underground.

00:04:59.205 --> 00:05:01.854
Is the family name
that lives on.

00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.091
It's all that lives on.

00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:08.983
Not your personal glory
not your honor... but family.

00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:12.341
You understand?

00:05:24.145 --> 00:05:27.744
You're blessed with ability
that few men possess.

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:31.759
You're blessed you belong to
the most powerful family in the kingdom.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:34.569
And you still blessed
with youth.

00:05:35.143 --> 00:05:37.643
And what you've done
with this blessing?

00:05:38.832 --> 00:05:42.458
You served as the glorified bodyguard
for two kings..

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:45.481
One a mad man, the other are drunk.

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:54.709
The future of our family will be
determined in these next few months.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.296
We could established a dinasty
that would last a thousand years...

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.430
or we could collapse into nothing.
As the Targaryen's did.

00:06:05.393 --> 00:06:09.431
I need you to become a man
you're always meant to be.

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:12.377
Not next year, not tomorrow...

00:06:13.351 --> 00:06:14.627
Now.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.428
You're in pain.

00:06:51.842 --> 00:06:53.728
I've had worse, my lady.

00:06:54.902 --> 00:06:56.815
Perhaps it's time to go hoome.

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:59.216
The south doesn't seems to agree with you..

00:06:59.217 --> 00:07:01.791
I knwo the truth Jon Arryn died for..

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.567
Do you, lord Stark?

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:08.988
Is that why you called me here?
To pose me riddles?

00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:11.423
Has he done this before?

00:07:13.192 --> 00:07:14.729
Jaime would've killed him.

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:18.440
My brother's worth
a thousand of your friend.

00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:19.528
Your brother...

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.341
or your lover?

00:07:26.504 --> 00:07:29.663
Targaryens wed brothers and sisters
for 300 years..

00:07:29.664 --> 00:07:31.341
to keep bloodlines pure.

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:34.105
Jaime and I are more than
brother and sister.

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:36.191
We shared a womb.

00:07:36.192 --> 00:07:39.194
Came to this world together,
we belong together.

00:07:39.942 --> 00:07:41.906
My son saw you with him.

00:07:48.817 --> 00:07:50.907
- Do you love your children?
- With all my heart.

00:07:50.942 --> 00:07:54.085
- No more than I love mine.
- And they're all Jaime's.

00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:55.359
Thank the Gods.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.876
In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,

00:07:58.877 --> 00:08:00.700
I finished him off another ways

00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:03.943
- In the morning he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

00:08:04.093 --> 00:08:05.299
Hated him?

00:08:05.848 --> 00:08:07.317
I worshipped him.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.456
Every girl in the southern kingdom
dreamt of him but he was mine by oath.

00:08:11.844 --> 00:08:15.680
And when I finally saw him on our wedding day
in the Sept of Baelor.

00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:20.306
lean and fierce, and black beared
it was the happiest moment of my life.

00:08:21.656 --> 00:08:24.030
And that night he crawl on top of me,
stinking of wine

00:08:24.065 --> 00:08:27.149
and did what he did what little he could do

00:08:28.932 --> 00:08:31.242
and whispered in my ear : "Lyanna".

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.990
Your sister was a corpse
and I was a living girl

00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:37.782
and he loved her more than me.

00:08:40.095 --> 00:08:43.280
When the king return from his hunts,
I'll tell him the truth.

00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:46.407
You must be gone by then...
you and your children.

00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:48.970
I will not have that blood on my hands.

00:08:49.263 --> 00:08:51.238
Go as far away as you can..

00:08:51.825 --> 00:08:54.062
With as many men as you can.

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:55.913
Because wherever you go...

00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:58.664
Robert's wrath will follow you.

00:08:59.262 --> 00:09:01.176
And what of my wrath, lord Stark?

00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:04.050
You should have taken the realm
for yourself.

00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:07.339
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:10.101
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.590
All you needed to do is claim the step
yourself. Such a sad mistake.

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:17.967
I've made many mistakes in my life..

00:09:19.003 --> 00:09:20.792
but that wasn't one of them.

00:09:20.816 --> 00:09:22.192
Oh, but it was.

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:26.980
When you play the game of thrones,
you win or you die.

00:09:28.065 --> 00:09:29.593
There is no middle ground.

00:10:17.692 --> 00:10:20.516
No, No, No, No..

00:10:21.968 --> 00:10:24.384
is that what they teach you
up in the North?

00:10:25.906 --> 00:10:28.869
And you, wherever you're from.

00:10:29.843 --> 00:10:33.494
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

00:10:33.782 --> 00:10:36.994
Either of you understand the thing that I'm saying?

00:10:37.969 --> 00:10:39.246
Yes, my lord.

00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:42.619
Lets start over. Shall we?

00:10:43.717 --> 00:10:47.308
You be the man, and you be the woman.

00:10:52.344 --> 00:10:53.658
Go ahead.

00:10:56.218 --> 00:10:57.594
Slowly.

00:11:06.782 --> 00:11:11.682
You're not fooling them,
they just paid you, they know what you are.

00:11:12.219 --> 00:11:14.434
They know its all just an act

00:11:14.531 --> 00:11:17.494
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

00:11:17.794 --> 00:11:19.243
And that takes time.

00:11:20.283 --> 00:11:21.600
You need to..

00:11:22.138 --> 00:11:24.496
ease into it.

00:11:26.844 --> 00:11:28.120
Go ahead.

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:31.808
Ease into it.

00:11:40.782 --> 00:11:43.871
He's winding you over,
inspite of yourself.

00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:46.184
You starting to like this.

00:11:47.283 --> 00:11:48.755
He wants to believe you.

00:11:48.844 --> 00:11:51.423
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough

00:11:51.424 --> 00:11:52.808
to play with a boy, shouldn't you?

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.281
He knows, he's better than other men.

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:59.995
He's always known it deep down inside
now he has proof.

00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:01.572
He's so good...

00:12:02.573 --> 00:12:07.059
he's reaching something deep inside of you
that no one even knew was there.

00:12:07.347 --> 00:12:09.997
Overcoming your very nature..

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:14.386
Why don't you join us, my lord?

00:12:15.658 --> 00:12:17.884
I'm saving myself for another.

00:12:18.746 --> 00:12:20.593
What she doesn't know
will not hurt her?

00:12:20.594 --> 00:12:22.073
A stupid saying..

00:12:22.845 --> 00:12:26.484
What we don't know is usually
what get us killed.

00:12:27.472 --> 00:12:29.184
She must be very beautiful.

00:12:29.223 --> 00:12:33.148
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines, though.

00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:35.121
I do believe my lord in love.

00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:38.384
For many years.
Most of my life really.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.350
Play with her ass.

00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:42.151
And she loved me too.

00:12:42.952 --> 00:12:44.952
I was her little confidant.

00:12:45.953 --> 00:12:49.753
A play thing. She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

00:12:50.154 --> 00:12:54.354
She told me about
all the horses that she liked.

00:12:54.355 --> 00:12:58.755
The castle that she want to live in.
The man that she wanted to marry.

00:12:59.457 --> 00:13:00.957
A northener..

00:13:01.358 --> 00:13:03.358
with a jaw like an anvil.

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:08.658
So I challenged him to a duel. I mean,
why not? I'd read all the stories.

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:13.250
The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.

00:13:13.342 --> 00:13:17.150
In the end...
she wouldn't even let him kill me.

00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:19.851
"He's just a boy", she said.

00:13:20.152 --> 00:13:21.952
"Please don't hurt him".

00:13:22.653 --> 00:13:26.953
So he gave me a nice little scar to remember
and by enough they went

00:13:26.954 --> 00:13:29.454
- And she still married to him?
- Oh, no.

00:13:29.655 --> 00:13:32.355
He got himself killed before the wedding.

00:13:33.656 --> 00:13:37.756
And she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive spciment.

00:13:38.057 --> 00:13:40.357
She love him, I'm afraid.

00:13:40.658 --> 00:13:42.258
And why wouldn't she, I mean?

00:13:42.358 --> 00:13:45.758
Who could compare to him,
he just so...

00:13:52.353 --> 00:13:53.453
good.

00:13:56.054 --> 00:13:58.954
Do you know what I learned
losing that duel?

00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:01.355
I learned that I'll never win.

00:14:01.756 --> 00:14:04.656
Not that way.
That's their game.

00:14:05.257 --> 00:14:06.757
Their rules.

00:14:07.658 --> 00:14:09.558
I'm not going to fight them.

00:14:09.859 --> 00:14:11.159
I'm going to fuck them.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.860
That's what I know, that's what I am.

00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:18.961
And only by admitting what we are,
can we get what we want.

00:14:19.962 --> 00:14:21.362
And what do you want?

00:14:22.263 --> 00:14:24.863
Oh, everything, my dear.

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:27.064
Everything there is.

00:14:30.365 --> 00:14:33.565
Now wash yourself,
both of you are working tonight.

00:15:04.274 --> 00:15:06.601
You're very lucky girl,
do you know that?

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:13.320
Where I come from we don't show mercy
to criminals.

00:15:13.488 --> 00:15:17.082
Where I come from,
if someone like you attacked a little lord..

00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:20.742
the low tide will lay you on your back,
on the beach..

00:15:20.911 --> 00:15:23.482
your hands and feet chained to four stakes..

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:26.462
sea will coming cloaser and closer.

00:15:26.984 --> 00:15:30.972
You'll see death creeping toward you,
a few inches at a time.

00:15:32.372 --> 00:15:33.735
Where do you come from?

00:15:34.365 --> 00:15:35.811
The Iron Islands.

00:15:36.583 --> 00:15:37.849
They far away?

00:15:38.255 --> 00:15:40.179
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

00:15:40.214 --> 00:15:44.031
Trust me, you've never heard
where I'm from neither.

00:15:45.099 --> 00:15:47.259
Trust me, my lord.

00:15:50.221 --> 00:15:52.446
You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

00:15:52.622 --> 00:15:56.586
In civilised land, you advert
your betters by their proper titles.

00:15:57.182 --> 00:15:58.422
And what's that?

00:15:58.842 --> 00:15:59.922
Lord.

00:16:00.405 --> 00:16:01.533
Why?

00:16:02.832 --> 00:16:03.824
Why?

00:16:04.618 --> 00:16:06.393
What do you mean "why"?

00:16:06.609 --> 00:16:09.736
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
lord of the Iron Islands.

00:16:09.811 --> 00:16:11.705
What's that got to do with you?

00:16:12.925 --> 00:16:16.861
Your father's lord,
how can you be lord too?

00:16:17.552 --> 00:16:21.103
- I will be lord after my father..
- So you're not lord now.

00:16:21.122 --> 00:16:22.219
No, you...

00:16:24.536 --> 00:16:26.346
You having a go at me?

00:16:26.545 --> 00:16:27.545
Is that it?

00:16:28.222 --> 00:16:31.074
Just don't understand
how you southerner do things.

00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:32.404
I'm not a southerner.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.656
You're from south of The Wall...

00:16:35.257 --> 00:16:37.457
that make you southerner to me.

00:16:39.783 --> 00:16:42.622
You're an impudent little wench,
aren't you?

00:16:43.496 --> 00:16:47.292
Couldn't say, my lord.
Didn't know what impunent means.

00:16:47.558 --> 00:16:50.790
Impudent. It means rude.

00:16:51.444 --> 00:16:52.761
Disrespectful.

00:16:56.989 --> 00:16:58.921
Do you want to loose that chain?

00:17:01.462 --> 00:17:03.096
Theon Greyjoy!

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.320
The lady is our guest.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.898
Thought she was our prisoner.

00:17:07.962 --> 00:17:11.606
Are the two mutually exclusive,
in your experience?

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.169
Chances are I won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

00:17:25.172 --> 00:17:27.408
I'm used to worst than him.

00:17:28.259 --> 00:17:31.160
I'm used to men
that can chew that boy up.

00:17:31.195 --> 00:17:33.534
And pick their teeth with his bones.

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:41.271
Why did you come here?

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.609
Didn't mean to come here.

00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:48.967
Meant to get much further south
than this. As far as south as south goes.

00:17:49.785 --> 00:17:51.966
Before the long night comes.

00:17:52.477 --> 00:17:53.532
Why?

00:17:53.755 --> 00:17:55.131
What do you afraid of?

00:17:56.044 --> 00:18:00.142
Those thing that sleep in the day
and hunt at night

00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:04.765
- Owl and shadowcats...
- I'm not talking about owl and shadowcats.

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.172
The thing you speak of..

00:18:12.045 --> 00:18:14.555
have been gone for thousand of years.

00:18:14.634 --> 00:18:16.544
It wasn't gone, old man.

00:18:18.145 --> 00:18:19.745
They were sleeping.

00:18:20.865 --> 00:18:23.331
And they're sleeping no more.

00:18:32.108 --> 00:18:33.743
I missed girls.

00:18:34.904 --> 00:18:37.550
Not even talking to them,
I never talk to them.

00:18:39.497 --> 00:18:41.147
Just lookin' at them.

00:18:41.368 --> 00:18:42.831
Hearing them giggle.

00:18:48.607 --> 00:18:50.324
Don't you missed girls?

00:18:55.668 --> 00:18:56.756
Riders!

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.489
The horn. We have to blow the horn.

00:19:01.504 --> 00:19:02.656
Why is he alone?

00:19:05.391 --> 00:19:07.760
One blast for a ranger returning

00:19:08.107 --> 00:19:09.544
Two for wildlings

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:12.394
- Three..
- He's no rider.

00:19:46.599 --> 00:19:48.691
That's my uncle Benjen rode..

00:19:56.159 --> 00:19:57.360
where's my uncle?

00:20:01.691 --> 00:20:02.693
Ned!

00:20:05.221 --> 00:20:06.468
Robert...

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.471
we are hunting... a boar...

00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:19.345
I should have spent more time with you.

00:20:20.357 --> 00:20:22.930
Shown to you how to be a man.

00:20:26.503 --> 00:20:29.152
I was never meant to be a father.

00:20:49.174 --> 00:20:50.182
Go on....

00:20:51.357 --> 00:20:53.220
you don't want to see this.

00:21:07.605 --> 00:21:08.864
My fault..

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.131
Too much wine..

00:21:11.752 --> 00:21:13.820
Missed my thrust..

00:21:22.731 --> 00:21:24.570
Stinks.

00:21:25.519 --> 00:21:27.402
Stinks like death.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.792
Don't think I can't smell it.

00:21:34.052 --> 00:21:36.917
Pay the bastard back, Ned.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.806
I drove my knife
right through his brain

00:21:39.807 --> 00:21:42.067
You ask him if I didn't. Ask him!

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:48.636
I want the funeral feast to be the biggest
the kingdom ever saw..

00:21:49.703 --> 00:21:53.491
And I want everyone
to taste the boar that got me

00:21:56.916 --> 00:22:00.344
Now leave us, the lot of you
I need to talk to Ned.

00:22:01.079 --> 00:22:04.041
- Robert, my sweet...
- Out! All of you!

00:22:23.722 --> 00:22:25.533
You damn fool.

00:22:26.113 --> 00:22:28.150
Paper and ink. On the table.

00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:30.051
Write down what I said.

00:22:38.057 --> 00:22:41.569
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:47.270
First of... you know how it goes.
Put in the damn titles..

00:22:48.186 --> 00:22:49.677
I hereby command..

00:22:50.078 --> 00:22:54.778
Eddard of House Stark...
titles..titles...

00:22:55.788 --> 00:23:00.802
to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of The Realm, upon my death..

00:23:01.537 --> 00:23:03.937
to rule in my stead..

00:23:04.536 --> 00:23:08.036
until my son Joffrey comes of age.

00:23:25.668 --> 00:23:26.724
Give it over..

00:23:42.752 --> 00:23:44.317
Give it to the council..

00:23:44.818 --> 00:23:46.318
after I'm death.

00:23:47.925 --> 00:23:52.479
At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.

00:23:52.676 --> 00:23:54.562
You'll rule now.

00:23:55.712 --> 00:23:58.175
You'll hate it worse than I did..

00:23:59.115 --> 00:24:00.560
but you'll do it well.

00:24:05.047 --> 00:24:06.285
The girl..

00:24:07.286 --> 00:24:08.586
Daenerys...

00:24:10.687 --> 00:24:11.987
you're right.

00:24:12.074 --> 00:24:16.173
Varys, Littlefinger, my brother..
Worthless..

00:24:17.051 --> 00:24:19.226
Noone to tell me "No" but you.

00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:22.527
Only you.

00:24:26.902 --> 00:24:28.353
Let her live

00:24:30.154 --> 00:24:33.354
- Stop it if its not to late.
- I will.

00:24:34.388 --> 00:24:35.660
My son...

00:24:37.261 --> 00:24:38.861
help him, Ned.

00:24:40.297 --> 00:24:42.209
Make him better than me

00:24:43.259 --> 00:24:44.369
I'll...

00:24:46.232 --> 00:24:49.200
I'll do everything I can
to honor your memory.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.966
My memory?

00:24:54.199 --> 00:24:56.837
King Robert Baratheon...

00:24:57.738 --> 00:25:00.138
murdered by a pig.

00:25:03.713 --> 00:25:07.062
Give me something to the pain,
and let me die.

00:25:21.824 --> 00:25:23.698
Give him milk of the poppy.

00:25:31.918 --> 00:25:34.611
He was reeling from the wine..

00:25:35.897 --> 00:25:37.275
He commanded us to...

00:25:37.676 --> 00:25:39.376
step aside, but...

00:25:40.723 --> 00:25:42.133
I failed him.

00:25:44.824 --> 00:25:47.776
No men could've protected him from himself.

00:25:49.424 --> 00:25:54.551
I wonder, Ser Barristan,
who gave the King this wine?

00:25:55.486 --> 00:25:58.361
His squire.
From the King's own skin.

00:25:58.446 --> 00:26:01.375
His squire? The Lannister boy?

00:26:01.697 --> 00:26:06.216
Such a dutiful boy to make sure
His Grace did not lack refreshment.

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:10.334
I do hope the poor lad
is not blame himself.

00:26:18.325 --> 00:26:22.747
His Grace has had a change of heart
concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.137
Whatever arrangements you made...

00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:31.168
unmade them, at once.

00:26:31.255 --> 00:26:34.560
I'm afraid those birds have flown.

00:26:34.774 --> 00:26:37.169
The Khaleesi likely dead already.

00:28:17.873 --> 00:28:20.101
Can you help me make him.. understand?

00:28:20.195 --> 00:28:22.936
The Dothraki do things on their own time
for their own reason

00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:26.559
Have patience, Khaleesi. We will
go home, I promise you.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:27.861
My brother...

00:28:28.062 --> 00:28:32.062
was a fool, I know.. but he was
the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.

00:28:33.422 --> 00:28:35.042
Have I said something funny, ser?

00:28:35.077 --> 00:28:38.066
Forgive me, khaleesi, but your ancestor,
Aegon The Conqueror,

00:28:38.067 --> 00:28:40.798
didn't seize six of the kingdoms
because it his right.

00:28:40.833 --> 00:28:43.530
He have no right to them,
he seized them because he could.

00:28:43.642 --> 00:28:45.338
And because he had dragons.

00:28:45.643 --> 00:28:48.245
Having few dragons makes things easier.

00:28:49.083 --> 00:28:52.572
- You don't believe it?
- Have you ever seen a dragon, khaleesi?

00:28:53.006 --> 00:28:55.758
I believe what my eyes and ears report.

00:28:56.057 --> 00:29:00.306
As for the rest, it was 300 years ago,
who knows what really happened.

00:29:00.366 --> 00:29:02.715
Now if you pardon me,
I'll seek out the merchant captain..

00:29:02.716 --> 00:29:05.716
- see if he has any letter for me.
- Well, I'll come with you.

00:29:05.734 --> 00:29:07.442
No, no, don't trouble yourself.

00:29:07.538 --> 00:29:10.779
Enjoy the market.
I'll rejoin you soon enough.

00:29:19.464 --> 00:29:21.191
Jorah, the Andal?

00:29:23.403 --> 00:29:27.302
The Spider sent his greetings
and his congratulations.

00:29:29.879 --> 00:29:31.415
Overall pardon,

00:29:31.668 --> 00:29:33.267
you can go home now.

00:30:13.314 --> 00:30:17.703
My son already has his name, but I'll
try your summer wine. Just a taste.

00:30:18.625 --> 00:30:20.910
My lady, you are from Westeros?

00:30:21.065 --> 00:30:24.726
You have the honor of addressing
Daenerys of the House Targaryen.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.836
Khaleesi of the riding men,
and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

00:30:29.326 --> 00:30:31.349
- Princess.
- Rise.

00:30:31.938 --> 00:30:33.826
I still like to taste that wine.

00:30:34.404 --> 00:30:35.463
That?

00:30:36.064 --> 00:30:39.464
Dorne's sweet not worthy of a princess.

00:30:39.578 --> 00:30:41.865
I have the dry red from the Arbor.

00:30:42.055 --> 00:30:43.600
Nectar of the Gods.

00:30:44.031 --> 00:30:45.789
Let me give you a cask.

00:30:46.152 --> 00:30:48.616
- A gift!
- You honor me, ser.

00:30:48.627 --> 00:30:51.079
The honor.. the honor is all mine.

00:30:56.342 --> 00:30:58.046
You know there are many in your homeland

00:30:58.047 --> 00:30:59.704
that pray for your return, princess.

00:30:59.739 --> 00:31:01.702
I hope to repay your kindness someday.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:13.981
The wine is for the Khaleesi,
it's not for the likes of you.

00:31:14.028 --> 00:31:15.088
Open it.

00:31:26.912 --> 00:31:27.911
Pour.

00:31:28.805 --> 00:31:32.212
It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich
without at least giving it time to breathe.

00:31:32.214 --> 00:31:33.601
Do as he says.

00:31:35.004 --> 00:31:36.703
As the princess command.

00:31:49.022 --> 00:31:50.515
Sweet, isn't it?

00:31:51.565 --> 00:31:53.322
Can you smell the fruit, ser?

00:31:54.561 --> 00:31:56.064
Taste it, my lord.

00:31:56.652 --> 00:32:00.335
Tell me that is not the finest wine
that has ever touch your tongue.

00:32:03.689 --> 00:32:04.955
You first.

00:32:07.594 --> 00:32:08.703
Me?

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.752
I'm afraid I'm not worthy of the vintage.

00:32:11.802 --> 00:32:14.849
Beside, is it a poor wine merchant
who drink up his own wares

00:32:14.898 --> 00:32:17.389
You will drink.

00:32:49.437 --> 00:32:50.477
Come.

00:32:57.714 --> 00:33:00.610
You came to us as outlaws..

00:33:00.888 --> 00:33:02.313
poachers..

00:33:02.925 --> 00:33:03.948
rapers..

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.302
killers, thieves...

00:33:06.427 --> 00:33:07.872
You came alone..

00:33:08.272 --> 00:33:09.751
in chains..

00:33:10.251 --> 00:33:13.334
without friends, or honor.

00:33:14.073 --> 00:33:15.861
You came to us rich..

00:33:16.338 --> 00:33:17.928
or you came to us poor.

00:33:18.423 --> 00:33:22.498
Some of you bear the name
of proud houses..

00:33:23.049 --> 00:33:26.040
all those only bastard names,
or no names at all.

00:33:26.139 --> 00:33:31.275
It does not matter.
All that, is in the past.

00:33:31.795 --> 00:33:32.879
Here..

00:33:33.863 --> 00:33:35.327
on the Wall.

00:33:36.163 --> 00:33:38.527
we're all one house.

00:33:39.699 --> 00:33:40.845
Tonight..

00:33:41.556 --> 00:33:43.727
We're allowed to look happy..

00:33:44.299 --> 00:33:45.823
you're going to be a ranger.

00:33:47.113 --> 00:33:49.122
It's not what you always wanted?

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.514
I want to find my uncle.

00:33:52.636 --> 00:33:55.937
I know he's alive out there.
I know he is.

00:33:57.176 --> 00:34:00.363
I wish I could help you,
but I'm no ranger.

00:34:01.078 --> 00:34:03.189
its the steward's life for me.

00:34:04.037 --> 00:34:06.129
You're honored being a steward.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.451
Not much, really.

00:34:08.835 --> 00:34:10.377
But those food.

00:34:15.735 --> 00:34:17.778
You begin a new.

00:34:24.733 --> 00:34:28.424
A man of the Night's Watch.

00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:32.558
live his life for the realm.

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.812
Not for King

00:34:36.242 --> 00:34:37.421
or a Lord..

00:34:37.612 --> 00:34:41.273
or the honor of this house or that house.

00:34:41.765 --> 00:34:44.316
Not for gold, glory,..

00:34:44.452 --> 00:34:46.278
or women's love.

00:34:47.196 --> 00:34:48.598
But for the realm..

00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:51.276
and all the people in it.

00:34:52.113 --> 00:34:55.854
You all learned the words, your vow

00:34:55.952 --> 00:34:58.878
Think carefully before you say them.

00:34:59.544 --> 00:35:01.665
The penalty for desertion..

00:35:02.426 --> 00:35:03.788
is death.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.440
You can take your vows here..

00:35:11.669 --> 00:35:12.869
tonight..

00:35:13.453 --> 00:35:14.544
at sunset.

00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:18.415
Do any of you still keep the Old Gods?

00:35:20.483 --> 00:35:21.988
I do, my lord.

00:35:22.392 --> 00:35:25.835
Do you want to take your vows before the heart tree,
as your uncle did?

00:35:25.901 --> 00:35:26.962
Yes, my lord.

00:35:27.072 --> 00:35:30.020
You'll find the weirwoods,
a mile north of the Wall..

00:35:30.112 --> 00:35:32.171
and your Old  Gods too, maybe.

00:35:33.923 --> 00:35:35.052
My Lord?

00:35:35.922 --> 00:35:37.137
Might I go as well?

00:35:37.164 --> 00:35:39.449
Is House Tarly keep the Old Gods?

00:35:39.683 --> 00:35:41.089
No, my lord..

00:35:41.835 --> 00:35:44.053
I was name in the light of the Seven..

00:35:44.154 --> 00:35:46.854
as my father was
and his father before him.

00:35:46.964 --> 00:35:50.590
Why would you forsake,
the Gods of your father and your house?

00:35:53.007 --> 00:35:55.637
The Night's Watch is my house now.

00:35:55.644 --> 00:35:58.324
The Seven have never answer my prayers..

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:00.811
perhaps the Old Gods will.

00:36:02.336 --> 00:36:03.586
As you wish.

00:36:04.964 --> 00:36:07.800
You all been,
assigned an order..

00:36:08.072 --> 00:36:10.386
according to our needs..

00:36:10.987 --> 00:36:13.087
and your strength.

00:36:13.161 --> 00:36:15.347
Halder, builders.

00:36:16.338 --> 00:36:18.037
Pyp, to the stewards.

00:36:18.184 --> 00:36:19.503
Tod, to the builders.

00:36:19.801 --> 00:36:21.152
Grenn, to the rangers.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.750
Samwell, to the stewards.

00:36:23.463 --> 00:36:26.403
Matthar, to the rangers.
Dareon, to the stewards.

00:36:26.909 --> 00:36:28.690
Ballion, to the rangers

00:36:29.013 --> 00:36:30.567
Rast, to the rangers

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.417
Jon, to the stewards.

00:36:32.628 --> 00:36:33.971
Lancel, to the builders.

00:36:34.258 --> 00:36:37.137
Ihyll, to the builders.
Gordor, to the stewards.

00:36:37.275 --> 00:36:40.439
Nikko, to the rangers.
Eskan, to the rangers.

00:36:40.749 --> 00:36:43.627
Albett, to the builders,
Jorden to the stables.

00:36:43.925 --> 00:36:45.236
Mikken, to the cooks.

00:36:45.463 --> 00:36:47.020
Halor, to the builders.

00:36:47.174 --> 00:36:49.501
Delugo, to the rangers.

00:36:49.757 --> 00:36:52.627
May all the Gods preserve you.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:00.389
Rangers, with me.

00:37:01.318 --> 00:37:02.462
Builders!

00:37:22.072 --> 00:37:23.161
Samwell...

00:37:23.488 --> 00:37:26.487
you will assisst me in the rookery
and the library.

00:37:26.742 --> 00:37:27.739
Pyp...

00:37:27.885 --> 00:37:30.814
you will report to Bowen Marsh,
in the kitchen.

00:37:30.937 --> 00:37:34.979
Luke, report to One Eye Joe in the stable..

00:37:35.708 --> 00:37:39.397
Dareon, I'm sending you to the east watch..

00:37:39.575 --> 00:37:42.289
present yourself to Borcas when you arrive..

00:37:42.447 --> 00:37:45.796
Make no comment about his nose.

00:37:47.334 --> 00:37:48.359
Jon Snow...

00:37:48.576 --> 00:37:52.776
Lord Commander Mormont has requested you
for his personal steward.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.901
Will I serve the Lord Commander's meal,

00:37:55.902 --> 00:37:57.890
and fetch hot water for his bath?

00:37:57.925 --> 00:37:58.923
Certainly.

00:37:59.124 --> 00:38:01.624
And keep the fire burning in his chambers..

00:38:01.625 --> 00:38:04.425
change his sheets
and blankets daily..

00:38:04.498 --> 00:38:08.313
and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.

00:38:11.341 --> 00:38:12.874
You take me for a servant?

00:38:12.972 --> 00:38:15.895
We took you for a man of the Night's Watch.

00:38:15.987 --> 00:38:18.835
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

00:38:19.488 --> 00:38:20.763
May I go?

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.464
As you wish.

00:38:28.186 --> 00:38:30.496
Jon! Wait!

00:38:30.625 --> 00:38:34.205
- Don't you see what they're doing?
- I see ser Alliser revenge thats all..

00:38:34.206 --> 00:38:36.005
he wanted it and he got it.

00:38:36.039 --> 00:38:38.269
Steward are nothing
but maid!

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.944
I'm a better swordman and rider than any of you!

00:38:41.043 --> 00:38:42.400
It's not fair!

00:38:42.478 --> 00:38:44.046
Fair?

00:38:44.563 --> 00:38:46.658
I was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall,

00:38:46.659 --> 00:38:49.572
when he put his hand in my leg
and he wanted to see my cock.

00:38:49.652 --> 00:38:51.143
I pushed him away and he said..

00:38:51.178 --> 00:38:53.685
he'd have my hand cut off
for stealing when he's over.

00:38:53.686 --> 00:38:55.625
So now I'm here,
at the end of the world,

00:38:55.626 --> 00:38:58.575
where noone to sing a folk,
but old men and little shit like you.

00:38:58.576 --> 00:39:00.503
I'll never see my family again.

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:03.948
I'll never been inside a women again.
Don't tell me about fair.

00:39:03.949 --> 00:39:05.974
I thought you were caught stealing
a wheel of cheese..

00:39:05.975 --> 00:39:07.862
for your starving sister.

00:39:07.897 --> 00:39:09.950
Course who's gonna teel a bunch of strangers..

00:39:09.951 --> 00:39:12.154
a high lord try to grab my cock?

00:39:14.504 --> 00:39:16.494
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?

00:39:16.744 --> 00:39:18.814
I'd like to hear a song.

00:39:23.334 --> 00:39:24.614
Now listen to me..

00:39:25.073 --> 00:39:28.367
the old man, is the Lord Commander
of The Night's Watch.

00:39:28.419 --> 00:39:33.063
You will be with him, day and night,
yes.. you will clean his clothes.

00:39:33.064 --> 00:39:35.420
You will also, take his letters..

00:39:35.421 --> 00:39:38.694
attend him at meeting,
squire for him at battle.

00:39:38.884 --> 00:39:42.253
You'll know everything,
be part of everything.

00:39:42.454 --> 00:39:44.904
And he ask for you himself.

00:39:45.564 --> 00:39:48.463
He wants to groom you for command.

00:39:53.643 --> 00:39:54.740
I just...

00:39:56.056 --> 00:39:58.263
I always wanted to be a ranger.

00:40:00.472 --> 00:40:02.522
I always wanted to be a wizard.

00:40:05.843 --> 00:40:07.133
What?

00:40:07.492 --> 00:40:09.002
No, I'm serious.

00:40:09.003 --> 00:40:11.813
So you'll stay and say your word with me?

00:40:18.263 --> 00:40:19.612
Lord Stark.

00:40:20.162 --> 00:40:21.502
A moment?

00:40:22.652 --> 00:40:24.292
Alone, if you will.

00:40:34.152 --> 00:40:36.292
He name you Protector of The Realm.

00:40:37.932 --> 00:40:39.112
He did.

00:40:39.631 --> 00:40:41.092
She won't care.

00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:44.132
Give me an hour and I'll put
a hundred of swords at your command.

00:40:44.902 --> 00:40:48.161
- And what should I do with a hundred swords?
- Strike!

00:40:48.162 --> 00:40:50.671
Tonight, while the castle sleeps.

00:40:50.862 --> 00:40:54.141
We must get Joffrey away from his mother
and into our custody.

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:58.081
Protector of The Realm or no,
he who holds the king holds the kingdom.

00:40:59.072 --> 00:41:02.370
Every moment you delay,
gives Cersei another moment to prepare.

00:41:02.371 --> 00:41:05.263
By the time Robert die,
it would be late for the both of us.

00:41:05.298 --> 00:41:06.911
What about Stannis?

00:41:06.971 --> 00:41:10.861
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
and delivering him to Stannis?

00:41:11.081 --> 00:41:13.450
You have odd notion about
"protecting the realm".

00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:15.120
Stannis is your older brother.

00:41:15.121 --> 00:41:17.661
This isn't about the bloody line of succession.

00:41:17.721 --> 00:41:19.624
That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King..

00:41:19.625 --> 00:41:22.342
it shouldn't matter now.

00:41:23.446 --> 00:41:25.476
What's the best for the kingdoms?

00:41:25.936 --> 00:41:28.445
What's best for the people we rule?

00:41:29.586 --> 00:41:31.896
We all know what Stannis is..

00:41:32.705 --> 00:41:35.326
He inspires no love, or loyalty.

00:41:35.765 --> 00:41:37.246
He's not a king.

00:41:38.776 --> 00:41:40.145
I am.

00:41:46.985 --> 00:41:48.775
Stannis is a commander.

00:41:49.715 --> 00:41:52.084
He's led men into war, twice.

00:41:52.085 --> 00:41:55.494
- He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
- Yes. he's a good soldier, everyone knows that.

00:41:55.495 --> 00:41:57.185
so is Robert.

00:41:58.084 --> 00:42:02.095
Tell me something. Do you still believe
good soldier made good king?

00:42:07.655 --> 00:42:11.425
I will not dishonor Robert's last hour
by shedding blood in his house..

00:42:12.095 --> 00:42:14.964
and dragging frightened children,
from their beds.

00:42:28.414 --> 00:42:30.814
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.

00:42:31.034 --> 00:42:33.864
You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.

00:42:35.464 --> 00:42:36.994
Not his steward.

00:42:38.304 --> 00:42:40.254
Not his captain of the guard.

00:42:40.704 --> 00:42:42.373
And not his wife.

00:42:48.163 --> 00:42:50.144
Only Stannis himself.

00:42:51.563 --> 00:42:52.903
Yes, my lord.

00:42:55.074 --> 00:42:56.443
Now leave us.

00:43:06.103 --> 00:43:07.933
My lord protector.

00:43:13.903 --> 00:43:16.101
The king has no trueborn son.

00:43:16.648 --> 00:43:20.563
Joffrey and Tommen, are Jaime Lannister's bastards.

00:43:21.452 --> 00:43:25.825
- So when the king dies..
- The throne passes to his brother..

00:43:27.192 --> 00:43:28.773
Lord Stannis.

00:43:29.753 --> 00:43:31.533
So it would seem.

00:43:32.982 --> 00:43:35.601
- Unless..
- There is no "unless"!

00:43:35.602 --> 00:43:37.897
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

00:43:37.932 --> 00:43:40.162
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

00:43:40.163 --> 00:43:44.262
You would be wise to denied to him.
And to make sure Joffrey succeeds.

00:43:47.282 --> 00:43:49.302
Do you have a shred of honor?

00:43:49.872 --> 00:43:53.365
You're now Hand of The King
and Protector of The Realm,

00:43:53.366 --> 00:43:58.982
all the power is yours, you need only..
reach out and take it.

00:43:59.112 --> 00:44:02.321
Make peace with the Lannisters.
Release The Imp.

00:44:02.522 --> 00:44:04.661
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

00:44:04.901 --> 00:44:06.945
We've plenty of time
to get rid of Stannis..

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:10.555
and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
when he come into his throne..

00:44:10.556 --> 00:44:13.069
we simply reveal his little secret..

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:15.966
- and sit Lord Renly there instead.
- We?

00:44:16.136 --> 00:44:20.001
You'll need someone to share this burdens,
I assure you..

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.651
my price would be modest.

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:25.661
Would you suggest this treason?

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.010
Only if we lose.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:32.790
Make peace with the Lannisters you say..

00:44:34.501 --> 00:44:36.818
The people who tried to murder my boy.

00:44:36.853 --> 00:44:42.611
We only make peace with our enemy, my lord.
That's why its called making peace.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.080
No...

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:46.280
I won't do it.

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:50.630
- So it will be Stannis? and war?
- There is no other choice.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.220
He is the heir.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:58.120
So why did you call me here?
Not for my wisdom clearly.

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.750
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

00:45:01.909 --> 00:45:04.859
The queen had a dozen knights
and hundred man-at-arms.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:08.400
Enough to overwhelm what remain
of my household guard.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.189
I need the Gold Cloaks.

00:45:11.519 --> 00:45:14.080
The City Watch is two thousand strong.

00:45:14.509 --> 00:45:17.069
and sworn to defend the king's peace.

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.469
Look at you.

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:26.589
You know what you want me to do.
You know it has to be done.

00:45:26.899 --> 00:45:29.199
But it's not honorable, so...

00:45:29.689 --> 00:45:31.909
the words stick in your throat.

00:45:32.389 --> 00:45:36.452
When the Queen proclaims one king,
and the Hand proclaim another..

00:45:36.453 --> 00:45:39.759
who's peace to the Gold Cloaks protect?

00:45:41.049 --> 00:45:42.918
Who do they follow?

00:45:47.849 --> 00:45:49.789
The man who pays them.

00:46:35.138 --> 00:46:39.508
Hear my words,
and bear witness to my vow

00:46:39.568 --> 00:46:43.028
Night gathers, and now my watch begins.

00:46:43.228 --> 00:46:46.076
It shall not end until my death.

00:46:46.438 --> 00:46:52.107
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.

00:46:52.438 --> 00:46:56.071
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.

00:46:56.337 --> 00:46:59.684
I shall live and die at my post.

00:46:59.827 --> 00:47:02.480
I am the sword in the darkness.

00:47:02.966 --> 00:47:05.387
I am the watcher on the walls.

00:47:05.696 --> 00:47:09.343
I am the shield that guards the realm of men.

00:47:09.736 --> 00:47:13.884
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,

00:47:13.885 --> 00:47:17.385
for this night and all the nights to come.

00:47:17.695 --> 00:47:19.626
You knelt as boys..

00:47:19.895 --> 00:47:22.705
rise now as men
of the Night's Watch.

00:47:35.793 --> 00:47:38.053
Welcome.. Welcome..

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.291
What he's got there?

00:47:46.528 --> 00:47:47.839
To me, Ghost.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.600
Bring it here.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:53.249
Gods be good.

00:48:00.482 --> 00:48:01.952
What will they do to him?

00:48:05.582 --> 00:48:06.891
When the khalasar rides..

00:48:06.926 --> 00:48:11.385
he'll be leashed to the saddle and forced
to run behind the horses, as long as he can.

00:48:11.787 --> 00:48:13.242
And when he falls?

00:48:14.892 --> 00:48:17.642
I saw a man last nine miles once.

00:48:19.392 --> 00:48:21.333
King Robert still wants me dead.

00:48:21.368 --> 00:48:24.352
This poisoner was the first,
he won't be the last.

00:48:24.472 --> 00:48:27.971
I thought he'd leave me alone,
now that my brother is gone.

00:48:27.972 --> 00:48:30.311
He will never leave you alone.

00:48:31.022 --> 00:48:34.271
If you ride to Asshai,
his assassins will follow you.

00:48:34.272 --> 00:48:38.061
If you sail all the way to the Basilisk Isle,
his spy would tell him.

00:48:38.062 --> 00:48:40.821
He will never abandon the hunt.

00:48:41.662 --> 00:48:43.461
You are Targaryen.

00:48:43.632 --> 00:48:45.410
The last Targaryen.

00:48:45.411 --> 00:48:47.815
Your son will have Targaryen blood..

00:48:47.816 --> 00:48:50.171
with 40.000 riders behind him.

00:48:51.491 --> 00:48:53.241
He will not have my son.

00:48:54.471 --> 00:48:56.671
He will not have you either, khaleesi.

00:51:59.123 --> 00:52:00.493
Lord Stark!

00:52:01.053 --> 00:52:02.972
- Stop!
- It's alright.

00:52:03.302 --> 00:52:05.695
- It's alright. Let him through.
- Lord Stark...

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:08.283
King Joffrey and the queen regent
request you presence in the throne room.

00:52:08.284 --> 00:52:10.186
King Joffrey?

00:52:10.321 --> 00:52:13.473
King Robert is gone.
The Gods give him rest.

00:52:25.873 --> 00:52:28.366
All is accomplished.
The City Watch is youts.

00:52:28.367 --> 00:52:29.718
Good.

00:52:30.618 --> 00:52:32.597
Is Lord Renly joining us?

00:52:34.257 --> 00:52:37.807
I fear Lord Renly
has left the city.

00:52:38.137 --> 00:52:41.300
He rode through the Old Gate
an hour before dawn..

00:52:41.301 --> 00:52:45.457
with ser Loras Tyrell
and some fifty retainers.

00:52:45.467 --> 00:52:49.507
Last seen galloping south in some haste.

00:53:09.866 --> 00:53:11.817
We stand behind you, lord Stark.

00:53:21.286 --> 00:53:26.017
All hail His Grace,
Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister.

00:53:26.018 --> 00:53:27.489
The First of His Name,

00:53:27.806 --> 00:53:30.017
The King of The Andal, and The First Men..

00:53:30.176 --> 00:53:35.263
Lord of The Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of The Realm.

00:53:53.406 --> 00:53:57.574
I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.

00:53:57.575 --> 00:54:00.116
I wish to be crowned within the forthnight.

00:54:00.305 --> 00:54:05.125
Today I shall accept oaths of fealty
from my loyal councillors.

00:54:09.255 --> 00:54:10.595
Ser Barristan...

00:54:11.125 --> 00:54:14.925
I believe no men here
could ever question your honor.

00:54:25.416 --> 00:54:27.086
King Robert seal.

00:54:27.586 --> 00:54:28.676
Unbroken.

00:54:36.304 --> 00:54:39.335
Lord Eddard Stark is herein named..

00:54:39.734 --> 00:54:41.724
Protector of The Realm..

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.728
to rule as regent...

00:54:44.729 --> 00:54:47.520
until the heir come of age.

00:54:48.659 --> 00:54:51.019
May I see that letter, ser Barristan?

00:54:59.568 --> 00:55:01.359
Protector of The Realm.

00:55:05.339 --> 00:55:07.769
Is this meant to be your shield,
Lord Stark?

00:55:08.878 --> 00:55:10.548
A piece of paper.

00:55:14.009 --> 00:55:15.507
Those were the king's words.

00:55:15.508 --> 00:55:17.449
We have a new king now.

00:55:19.828 --> 00:55:23.758
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
you offer me some counsel.

00:55:23.898 --> 00:55:26.039
Allow me to return the courtesy.

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.290
Bend the knee, my lord.

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:31.990
Bend the knee
and swear loyalty to my son.

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:35.235
And we shall allow you to live out the days
in the grey waste..

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:37.861
you called home.

00:55:38.009 --> 00:55:40.548
Your son has no claim to the throne.

00:55:40.579 --> 00:55:41.316
Liar!

00:55:41.317 --> 00:55:44.281
You condemn yourself
with your own mouth, Lord Stark.

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:46.870
Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:51.359
Ser Barristan is a good man,
a loyal man, do him no harm.

00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:55.480
You think you stands alone?

00:55:58.398 --> 00:56:01.509
Kill him! Kill all of them.
I commanded.

00:56:01.798 --> 00:56:03.018
Commander!

00:56:03.488 --> 00:56:06.177
Take the queen and
her children to custody.

00:56:06.178 --> 00:56:10.067
Escort them back to the royal apartment
and keep them there under guard.

00:56:10.068 --> 00:56:11.508
Men of the watch!

00:56:15.998 --> 00:56:17.758
I want no bloodshed.

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:22.748
Tell your men to lay down their swords,
noone needs to die.

00:56:25.038 --> 00:56:26.138
Now!

00:56:37.567 --> 00:56:40.468
I did warn you not to trust me.
