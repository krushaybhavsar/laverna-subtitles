WEBVTT

00:00:00.727 --> 00:00:02.930
Still not far
<i>from Pentos, Your Grace.</i>

00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:04.320
You'd be more
comfortable there.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.807
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:08.642
I'll stay with Drogo
until he fulfills

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:11.276
his end of the bargain
and I have my crown.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.046
I have something for you.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.981
First lesson: Stick them
with the pointy end.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:20.252
17 years ago you rode off
with Robert Baratheon.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:23.988
- <i>And now you're leaving again.</i>
- <i>I have no choice.</i>

00:00:24.022 --> 00:00:26.389
There's great honor serving
in the Night's Watch.

00:00:26.424 --> 00:00:28.958
The Starks have manned the
Wall for thousands of years.

00:00:28.992 --> 00:00:30.626
<i>And you are a Stark.</i>

00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:33.931
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.500
What of it?
Tell me we're not speaking of this.

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:39.937
I'll kill every Targaryen
I get my hands on.

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:43.641
Rapers. Not impressed
by your new brothers?

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:45.543
<i>Lovely thing about the watch--</i>

00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:49.112
<i>You discard your old family</i>
<i>and get a whole new one.</i>

00:00:49.147 --> 00:00:50.947
Welcome.

00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:53.517
I don't think Bran
fell from that tower.

00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:55.852
I think he was thrown.
No!

00:00:55.886 --> 00:00:58.721
<i>Someone tried</i>
<i>to kill him twice.</i>

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:01.189
<i>I would stake my life</i>
<i>the Lannisters are involved.</i>

00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:05.293
- Lord Stark must be told of this.
- <i>I will go myself.</i>

00:01:05.327 --> 00:01:07.227
What is the meaning of this?

00:01:07.262 --> 00:01:09.230
<i>Joff told us what happened.</i>

00:01:09.264 --> 00:01:12.700
<i>You and that boy beat him with clubs while</i>
<i>you set your wolf on him.</i>

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:14.535
<i>That's not what happened!</i>

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.703
Ahh!

00:01:15.738 --> 00:01:18.173
We found no trace of the
direwolf, Your Grace.

00:01:18.207 --> 00:01:21.244
- We have another wolf.
- As you will.

00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:23.112
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:25.749
<i>Lady didn't bite anyone!</i>
<i>She's good!</i>

00:01:35.926 --> 00:01:46.000

00:03:43.248 --> 00:03:45.115
Welcome, Lord Stark.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.984
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the small council.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.119
The honor of your
presence is requested.

00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:54.724
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.

00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:57.393
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, My Lord.

00:03:57.428 --> 00:04:01.164
If you'd like to change into
something more appropriate...

00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:39.670
Thank the gods
you're here, Stark.

00:04:40.638 --> 00:04:44.163
About time we had some stern
northern leadership.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.777
About glad to see you're
protecting the throne.

00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:48.845
Sturdy old thing.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.348
How many kings' asses
have polished it, I wonder?

00:04:51.383 --> 00:04:53.383
Um, what's the line?

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:56.521
The King shits
and the Hand wipes.

00:04:56.555 --> 00:05:00.025
Very handsome armor.

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:02.461
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.

00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:06.032
People have been swinging at me for
years, but they always seem to miss.

00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:08.935
You've chosen your
opponents wisely then.

00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:12.206
I have a knack for it.

00:05:15.343 --> 00:05:18.478
It must be strange for you
coming into this room.

00:05:20.748 --> 00:05:23.717
I was standing right here
when it happened.

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:26.786
He was very brave,
your brother.

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:28.622
Your father too.

00:05:28.656 --> 00:05:30.790
They didn't deserve
to die like that.

00:05:30.825 --> 00:05:33.693
Nobody deserves
to die like that.

00:05:33.728 --> 00:05:35.595
But you just stood there
and watched.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.599
500 men just stood there
and watched.

00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:41.402
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms--

00:05:41.436 --> 00:05:43.837
You think anyone said a
word, lifted a finger?

00:05:43.872 --> 00:05:46.473
No, Lord Stark.

00:05:46.508 --> 00:05:51.111
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.249
Except for the screams,
of course,

00:05:55.283 --> 00:05:58.118
and the Mad King laughing.

00:05:58.153 --> 00:06:00.888
And later...

00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:03.556
When I watched
the Mad King die,

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.959
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

00:06:08.262 --> 00:06:09.929
It felt like justice.

00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:15.601
Is that what you
tell yourself at night?

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.406
You're a servant of justice?

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.508
That you were avenging
my father when you

00:06:21.543 --> 00:06:24.112
shoved your sword in
Aerys Targaryen's back?

00:06:24.146 --> 00:06:25.914
Tell me--

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:28.984
If I'd stabbed the Mad King in
the belly instead of the back,

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:31.588
would you admire me more?

00:06:31.622 --> 00:06:34.157
You served him well

00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:37.127
when serving was safe.

00:06:48.974 --> 00:06:51.209
Lord Stark.

00:06:53.645 --> 00:06:55.446
Lord Varys.

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:58.849
I was grievously sorry to hear of
your troubles on the Kingsroad.

00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:02.519
We are all praying for prince
Joffrey's full recovery.

00:07:02.554 --> 00:07:05.989
A shame you didn't say a
prayer for the butcher's son.

00:07:07.124 --> 00:07:10.426
Renly!
You're looking well.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.228
And you look
tired from the road.

00:07:12.262 --> 00:07:14.430
I told them this meeting
could wait another day, but--

00:07:14.464 --> 00:07:17.233
<i>But we have a kingdom</i>
<i>to look after.</i>

00:07:17.267 --> 00:07:20.536
I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.173
- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

00:07:24.207 --> 00:07:27.276
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.546
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.549
from navel to collarbone.

00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:34.651
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

00:07:34.685 --> 00:07:36.653
It wasn't the <i>man</i>
that I chose, My Lord.

00:07:36.687 --> 00:07:39.056
It was Catelyn Tully.

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:42.427
A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:45.130
I humbly beg your pardon,
my Lord Stark.

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:47.800
Grand Maester.

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:50.036
How many years has it been?

00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:53.740
- <i>You were a young man.</i>
- And you served another King.

00:07:55.543 --> 00:07:58.311
Oh, how forgetful of me.

00:07:59.881 --> 00:08:02.181
This belongs to you, now.

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:06.553
<i>Should we begin?</i>

00:08:07.755 --> 00:08:09.623
- Without the King?
- Winter may be coming,

00:08:09.657 --> 00:08:12.960
but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

00:08:12.994 --> 00:08:15.061
His Grace has many cares.

00:08:15.096 --> 00:08:18.097
He entrusts some
small matters to us

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:19.932
that we might lighten the load.

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:22.868
We are the lords
of small matters here.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.308
<i>My brother instructs us</i>
<i>to stage a tournament</i>

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.178
in honor of Lord Stark's
appointment as Hand of the King.

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:36.882
- Mmm, how much?
- 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:38.617
<i>20,000 to the runner-up,</i>

00:08:38.652 --> 00:08:41.787
20,000 to the winning archer.

00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:44.124
Can the treasury bear
such expense?

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.094
I'll have to borrow it.
The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect.

00:08:47.128 --> 00:08:50.064
We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold.
What's another 80,000?

00:08:50.098 --> 00:08:52.232
Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?

00:08:52.267 --> 00:08:54.334
I'm telling you the Crown
is <i>six</i> million in debt.

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:56.269
How could you let this happen?

00:08:56.303 --> 00:08:58.070
The Master of Coin
finds the money.

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.539
The King and the Hand spend it.

00:09:00.574 --> 00:09:02.308
I will not believe Jon Arryn

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:04.143
allowed Robert
to bankrupt the realm.

00:09:04.177 --> 00:09:07.146
Lord Arryn gave wise
and prudent advice,

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.448
but I fear His Grace

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:13.385
- doesn't always listen.
- "Counting coppers," he calls it.

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:15.787
I'll speak to him tomorrow.

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:18.690
This tournament is an
extravagance we cannot afford.

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:21.092
As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.

00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:23.260
There will be no plans

00:09:23.294 --> 00:09:25.629
until I speak to Robert.

00:09:29.166 --> 00:09:31.167
Forgive me, my Lords.
I'm--

00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:34.871
- <i>I had a long ride.</i>
- You are the King's Hand,

00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:38.475
Lord Stark, we serve
at your pleasure.

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:47.586
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:53.426
- It's ugly.
- A King should have scars

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.263
you fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

00:09:57.297 --> 00:09:59.599
I'm not like him.
I didn't fight off anything.

00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:01.635
It bit me and all
I did was scream.

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:03.937
And the two Stark girls
saw it, both of them.

00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:07.041
That's not true.
You killed the beast.

00:10:07.075 --> 00:10:10.277
You only spared the girl because of the
love your father bears her father.

00:10:10.311 --> 00:10:11.138
I didn't, I--

00:10:11.258 --> 00:10:13.328
When Aerys Targaryen
sat on the Iron Throne,

00:10:13.448 --> 00:10:15.916
your father was a rebel
and a traitor.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:20.320
Someday you'll sit on the throne and
the truth will be what you make it.

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:25.790
Do I have to marry her?

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:27.625
Yes.

00:10:28.927 --> 00:10:31.028
She's very beautiful and young.

00:10:31.062 --> 00:10:34.298
If you don't like her, you only
need to see her on formal occasions

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:38.235
and when the time comes, to make
little princes and princesses.

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:43.408
And if you'd rather fuck painted
whores, you'll fuck painted whores.

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:46.544
And if you'd rather lie with
noble virgins, so be it.

00:10:46.578 --> 00:10:48.612
You are my darling boy
and the world will be

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:50.881
exactly as you want it to be.

00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:56.354
Do something nice
for the Stark girl.

00:10:56.388 --> 00:10:58.657
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:02.761
The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:05.831
We allow the northerners
too much power.

00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:08.234
They consider themselves
our equals.

00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:10.403
How would you handle them?

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:12.605
I'd double their taxes

00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:16.141
and command them to supply
10,000 men to the royal army.

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:19.444
- A royal army?
- Why should every lord command his own men?

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:21.812
It's primitive, no better
than the hill tribes.

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:24.782
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

00:11:24.816 --> 00:11:26.650
trained by
experienced soldiers--

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:30.287
Instead of a mob of peasants who've
never held pikes in their lives.

00:11:30.321 --> 00:11:32.889
And if the northerners rebel?

00:11:32.923 --> 00:11:34.558
I'd crush them.

00:11:34.592 --> 00:11:37.294
Seize Winterfell and install
someone loyal to the realm

00:11:37.328 --> 00:11:40.263
as Warden of the North.
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

00:11:40.298 --> 00:11:43.967
And these 10,000 northern troops, would
they fight for you or their lord?

00:11:44.001 --> 00:11:46.436
- For me. I'm their King.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.571
But you've just
invaded their homeland,

00:11:48.605 --> 00:11:51.373
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.

00:11:51.408 --> 00:11:54.410
The North cannot be held--
not by an outsider.

00:11:54.444 --> 00:11:57.079
It's too big and too wild.
And when the winter comes,

00:11:57.113 --> 00:12:00.449
the seven gods together couldn't
save you and your royal army.

00:12:00.483 --> 00:12:03.451
A good King knows
when to save his strength...

00:12:04.954 --> 00:12:07.288
And when to destroy
his enemies.

00:12:07.322 --> 00:12:10.057
So you agree...

00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:12.493
The Starks are enemies?

00:12:14.496 --> 00:12:17.231
Everyone who isn't us

00:12:17.266 --> 00:12:19.267
is an enemy.

00:12:21.537 --> 00:12:24.139
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

00:12:24.174 --> 00:12:26.075
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.177
- The prince.
- <i>Arya, stop!</i>

00:12:28.212 --> 00:12:31.381
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

00:12:31.415 --> 00:12:33.208
The Hound killed your friend.

00:12:33.328 --> 00:12:35.266
The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.

00:12:35.386 --> 00:12:37.988
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth

00:12:38.022 --> 00:12:40.724
- Mycah would be alive.
- Enough!

00:12:42.326 --> 00:12:44.027
What's happening here?

00:12:44.061 --> 00:12:47.363
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

00:12:49.032 --> 00:12:51.367
Go to your room.
We'll speak later.

00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:02.179
That's for you, love.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.425
<i>The same dollmaker makes all</i>
<i>of Princess Myrcella's toys.</i>

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:18.264
Don't you like it?

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:21.201
I haven't played with dolls
since I was eight.

00:13:22.637 --> 00:13:25.372
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

00:13:26.575 --> 00:13:29.077
It's all right.
Go on.

00:13:38.286 --> 00:13:40.720
War was easier than daughters.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.425
Go away!

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.027
<i>Arya, open the door.</i>

00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:02.272
May I come in?

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:11.414
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:13.283
Give it to me.

00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.894
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:26.832
Where did you get this?

00:14:30.738 --> 00:14:32.972
This is no toy.

00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:37.776
- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- I wasn't playing.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.744
And I don't want to be a lady.

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:42.179
Come here.

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:49.753
Now what do you want with this?

00:14:49.787 --> 00:14:51.688
It's called Needle.

00:14:51.722 --> 00:14:54.358
Oh, a blade with a name.

00:14:55.593 --> 00:14:58.295
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

00:14:58.329 --> 00:15:00.064
Your sister?

00:15:00.098 --> 00:15:02.466
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.268
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

00:15:04.302 --> 00:15:07.304
That's the essence of it.

00:15:09.941 --> 00:15:12.176
I was trying to learn.

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:16.781
I asked Mycah
to practice with me.

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:20.253
I asked him.

00:15:21.455 --> 00:15:24.157
- It was my fault.
- No, sweet girl.

00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:27.694
No no, you didn't kill
the butcher's boy.

00:15:28.896 --> 00:15:32.132
I hate them!
I hate all of them.

00:15:32.166 --> 00:15:34.768
The Hound, the Queen
and the King

00:15:34.802 --> 00:15:36.309
and Joffrey and Sansa.

00:15:36.429 --> 00:15:39.955
Sansa was dragged before
the King and Queen...

00:15:40.075 --> 00:15:42.709
And asked to call
the prince a liar.

00:15:42.744 --> 00:15:45.245
So was I!
He <i>is</i> a liar.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.381
Shh, darling, listen to me.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.886
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey's someday.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.222
She cannot betray him.

00:15:54.256 --> 00:15:57.092
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

00:15:58.361 --> 00:16:01.030
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

00:16:02.933 --> 00:16:04.834
Well.

00:16:06.437 --> 00:16:08.939
Look at me.

00:16:08.973 --> 00:16:12.242
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

00:16:14.378 --> 00:16:15.812
Winter is coming.

00:16:17.113 --> 00:16:19.515
You were born
in the long summer.

00:16:19.549 --> 00:16:21.650
You've never known
anything else.

00:16:21.684 --> 00:16:23.718
But now winter is truly coming.

00:16:23.753 --> 00:16:26.654
And in the winter,
we must protect ourselves,

00:16:26.688 --> 00:16:31.125
look after one another.
Sansa is your sister.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.729
I don't hate her.

00:16:34.763 --> 00:16:36.931
Not really.

00:16:38.199 --> 00:16:40.167
I don't want to frighten you,

00:16:40.202 --> 00:16:42.036
but I won't lie to you either.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.472
We've come
to a dangerous place.

00:16:44.506 --> 00:16:48.143
We cannot fight a war
amongst ourselves.

00:16:49.045 --> 00:16:51.046
All right?

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.016
Go on.
It's yours.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.420
I can keep it?

00:16:59.454 --> 00:17:02.623
Try not to stab
your sister with it.

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:13.565
If you're going to own a sword,

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.467
you'd better
know how to use it.

00:17:23.274 --> 00:17:26.909
Don't listen to it.
Crows are all liars.

00:17:29.146 --> 00:17:32.748
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.

00:17:32.783 --> 00:17:36.620
I know a story about a boy
who hated stories.

00:17:36.654 --> 00:17:40.024
I could tell you about
Ser Duncan the Tall.

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:42.026
Those were always
your favorites.

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:44.429
Those weren't my favorites.

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:47.099
My favorites were
the scary ones.

00:17:48.502 --> 00:17:52.705
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

00:17:54.174 --> 00:17:55.975
Fear is for the winter,

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.979
when the snows fall
a hundred feet deep.

00:17:59.013 --> 00:18:01.115
Fear is for the long night,

00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:04.118
when the sun hides for years

00:18:04.152 --> 00:18:06.888
and children are born
and live and die

00:18:06.923 --> 00:18:09.624
all in darkness.

00:18:09.659 --> 00:18:12.694
That is the time for fear,
my little Lord,

00:18:12.729 --> 00:18:16.064
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

00:18:17.433 --> 00:18:20.602
Thousands of years ago
there came a night

00:18:20.637 --> 00:18:22.738
that lasted a generation.

00:18:22.772 --> 00:18:25.708
Kings froze to death
in their castles,

00:18:25.742 --> 00:18:27.976
same as the shepherds
in their huts.

00:18:28.011 --> 00:18:30.880
And women smothered
their babies

00:18:30.914 --> 00:18:33.049
<i>rather than see them starve,</i>

00:18:33.083 --> 00:18:37.086
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

00:18:37.121 --> 00:18:40.824
So is this the sort
of story that you like?

00:18:43.862 --> 00:18:45.963
In that darkness,

00:18:45.998 --> 00:18:48.500
the White Walkers
came for the first time.

00:18:48.534 --> 00:18:51.669
<i>They swept through cities</i>
<i>and kingdoms,</i>

00:18:51.704 --> 00:18:53.871
<i>riding their dead horses,</i>

00:18:53.905 --> 00:18:57.841
hunting with their packs of
pale spiders big as hounds--

00:19:02.059 --> 00:19:04.406
What are you telling him now?

00:19:04.526 --> 00:19:06.615
Only what what are the little
lord wants to hear.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:11.885
Get your supper.
I want some time with him.

00:19:19.896 --> 00:19:22.298
One time she told me

00:19:22.332 --> 00:19:24.601
the sky is blue because
we live inside the eye

00:19:24.635 --> 00:19:27.470
of a blue-eyed giant
named Macomber.

00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:29.739
Maybe we do.

00:19:32.075 --> 00:19:34.410
How do you feel?

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.914
You still don't
remember anything?

00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:43.852
Bran,

00:19:43.886 --> 00:19:46.053
I've seen you climb
a thousand times.

00:19:46.088 --> 00:19:47.955
In the wind, in the rain--

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.090
A thousand times.

00:19:50.124 --> 00:19:52.492
- You never fall.
- I did though.

00:19:55.463 --> 00:19:57.730
It's true, isn't it,

00:19:57.765 --> 00:20:01.101
what Maester Luwin
says about my legs?

00:20:08.576 --> 00:20:10.611
I'd rather be dead.

00:20:11.913 --> 00:20:15.117
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.

00:20:26.764 --> 00:20:29.400
Fewer eyes back here, My Lady.

00:20:29.434 --> 00:20:31.435
But still too many.

00:20:31.469 --> 00:20:34.104
It's nine years since I've
set foot in the capital.

00:20:34.138 --> 00:20:37.507
And no one knew who I was the
last time I came either.

00:20:41.044 --> 00:20:43.545
My Lady.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.848
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

00:20:46.883 --> 00:20:48.749
I would.
We've done nothing wrong.

00:20:48.784 --> 00:20:51.085
We've been instructed to
escort you into the city.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.920
Instructed?

00:20:52.955 --> 00:20:55.657
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but--

00:20:55.691 --> 00:20:57.425
Follow me, Lady Stark.

00:21:08.338 --> 00:21:11.141
Cat!
Go on.

00:21:11.175 --> 00:21:13.009
Go upstairs.

00:21:15.213 --> 00:21:17.914
You little worm!

00:21:17.949 --> 00:21:20.717
You take me for some
back-alley Sally

00:21:20.752 --> 00:21:22.185
you can drag into a--

00:21:24.089 --> 00:21:25.689
Pssst!

00:21:27.725 --> 00:21:29.760
I meant no disrespect

00:21:29.794 --> 00:21:32.162
to you of all people.

00:21:32.196 --> 00:21:34.330
How dare you bring me here!

00:21:34.365 --> 00:21:36.165
Have you lost your mind?

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.835
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

00:21:38.869 --> 00:21:42.405
I'm truly sorry
about the locale.

00:21:42.439 --> 00:21:44.908
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.011
A dear friend told me.

00:21:49.646 --> 00:21:52.481
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

00:21:52.516 --> 00:21:56.518
To see you again after so
many years is a blessing.

00:21:56.553 --> 00:21:58.053
Your poor hands.

00:22:00.489 --> 00:22:02.090
How did you know I was coming?

00:22:02.124 --> 00:22:04.592
Knowledge is my trade, My Lady.

00:22:06.394 --> 00:22:08.929
Did you bring the dagger
with you, by any chance?

00:22:10.531 --> 00:22:12.932
My little birds
are everywhere...

00:22:12.966 --> 00:22:15.201
Even in the north.

00:22:15.235 --> 00:22:18.771
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:26.245
Valyrian steel.

00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:29.048
Do you know whose dagger
this is?

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.485
I must admit I do not.

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:36.388
Well well, this is an historic day.

00:22:36.423 --> 00:22:38.524
Something you don't know

00:22:38.558 --> 00:22:41.026
<i>that I do.</i>

00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:46.865
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

00:22:48.301 --> 00:22:50.869
- It's mine.
- Yours?

00:22:50.903 --> 00:22:55.473
At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

00:22:55.508 --> 00:22:58.343
I bet on Ser Jaime
in the jousting,

00:22:58.377 --> 00:23:00.179
as any sane man would.

00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:02.714
When the Knight of the
Glowers unseated him,

00:23:02.749 --> 00:23:05.318
I lost this dagger.

00:23:05.352 --> 00:23:07.520
To whom?

00:23:07.554 --> 00:23:09.422
Tyrion Lannister.

00:23:09.457 --> 00:23:11.625
The Imp.

00:23:11.659 --> 00:23:14.461
<i>Grenn, show him what</i>
<i>you farm boys are made of.</i>

00:23:19.834 --> 00:23:22.802
If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.

00:23:22.837 --> 00:23:26.105
Lord Snow here
grew up in a castle

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.441
spitting down
on the likes of you.

00:23:28.475 --> 00:23:30.577
Pyp.

00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:32.613
Do you think
Ned Stark's bastard

00:23:32.647 --> 00:23:34.682
bleeds like the rest of us?

00:23:41.956 --> 00:23:43.624
Next!

00:23:54.237 --> 00:23:55.837
<i>Next!</i>

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.151
Well, Lord Snow,

00:24:11.185 --> 00:24:13.686
<i>it appears you're</i>
<i>the least useless person here.</i>

00:24:14.888 --> 00:24:16.322
Go clean yourselves up.

00:24:16.356 --> 00:24:19.259
<i>There's only so much</i>
<i>I can stomach in a day.</i>

00:24:19.293 --> 00:24:22.262
A charming man.

00:24:22.296 --> 00:24:24.397
<i>I don't need him</i>
<i>to be charming.</i>

00:24:24.431 --> 00:24:27.100
I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

00:24:27.135 --> 00:24:28.969
into men of the Night's Watch.

00:24:29.003 --> 00:24:31.805
And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.208
Slowly.

00:24:36.478 --> 00:24:38.112
A raven came

00:24:38.147 --> 00:24:40.048
for Ned Stark's son.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.122
Good news or bad?

00:24:46.156 --> 00:24:47.857
Both.

00:24:49.126 --> 00:24:52.294
<i>Lord Stark.</i>

00:24:52.329 --> 00:24:55.331
I meant to give you this earlier.

00:24:57.467 --> 00:24:59.669
So forgetful these days.

00:25:01.504 --> 00:25:04.273
A raven from Winterfell
this morning.

00:25:14.983 --> 00:25:17.251
Good news?

00:25:20.622 --> 00:25:23.224
Perhaps you'd like to
share it with your wife?

00:25:25.761 --> 00:25:28.363
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

00:25:36.372 --> 00:25:38.640
<i>Yes, I'm looking at you.</i>

00:25:41.944 --> 00:25:43.945
I thought that she'd
be safest in here.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.881
One of several such
establishments I own.

00:25:49.118 --> 00:25:50.586
You're a funny man.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.222
Huh?
A very funny man.

00:25:54.491 --> 00:25:55.791
Ned!

00:26:03.401 --> 00:26:05.202
Ah, the Starks--

00:26:05.237 --> 00:26:08.473
Quick tempers, slow minds.

00:26:13.246 --> 00:26:15.948
You broke my nose, bastard!

00:26:23.189 --> 00:26:25.257
It's an improvement.

00:26:28.427 --> 00:26:31.596
If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder
how long it would take you to hit.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.665
I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

00:26:38.371 --> 00:26:40.472
What're you looking at,
Half Man?

00:26:40.506 --> 00:26:43.041
I'm looking at you.

00:26:43.075 --> 00:26:45.343
<i>Yes.</i>

00:26:45.378 --> 00:26:48.446
<i>You've got an interesting face.</i>

00:26:49.448 --> 00:26:52.651
Hmm, very distinctive faces.

00:26:52.685 --> 00:26:54.319
All of you.

00:26:54.353 --> 00:26:56.555
And what do you care
about our faces?

00:26:56.589 --> 00:26:59.791
It's just I think
they would look marvelous

00:26:59.826 --> 00:27:02.461
decorating spikes
in King's Landing.

00:27:02.495 --> 00:27:05.630
Perhaps I'll write my sister,
the Queen, about it.

00:27:07.867 --> 00:27:10.202
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

00:27:15.875 --> 00:27:18.476
Everybody knew
what this place was

00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:20.479
and no one told me.

00:27:20.513 --> 00:27:22.915
No one but you.

00:27:22.949 --> 00:27:24.783
My father knew

00:27:24.818 --> 00:27:27.086
and he left me to rot
at the Wall all the same.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.754
Grenn's father left him too...

00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:32.125
Outside a farmhouse
when he was three.

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:36.029
<i>Pyp was caught stealing</i>
<i>a wheel of cheese.</i>

00:27:36.063 --> 00:27:39.466
His little sister hadn't
eaten in three days.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.237
He was given a choice:
his right hand or the Wall.

00:27:43.271 --> 00:27:45.805
I've been asking the Lord
commander about them.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.024
Fascinating stories.

00:27:47.144 --> 00:27:49.347
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:50.978
It's a lucky thing
none of them were trained

00:27:51.012 --> 00:27:53.547
by a master-at-arms
like your Ser Rodrik.

00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:56.416
I don't imagine any of them
have ever held a real sword

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.552
before they came here.

00:28:01.756 --> 00:28:03.723
Oh...

00:28:03.758 --> 00:28:06.793
Your brother Bran.

00:28:06.828 --> 00:28:09.129
He's woken up.

00:28:10.398 --> 00:28:12.499
The mere suggestion
that the Queen's brother

00:28:12.533 --> 00:28:14.834
tried to kill your boy
would be considered treason.

00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:17.104
We have proof.
We have the blade.

00:28:17.138 --> 00:28:19.272
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

00:28:19.307 --> 00:28:21.875
The only man who could say
otherwise has no throat,

00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:24.143
thanks to your boy's wolf.

00:28:24.178 --> 00:28:27.146
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.

00:28:28.382 --> 00:28:30.283
He's like a little brother
to me, Ned.

00:28:30.318 --> 00:28:32.552
He would never betray my trust.

00:28:32.586 --> 00:28:35.187
I'll try to keep you
alive, for her sake.

00:28:35.222 --> 00:28:36.856
A fool's task, admittedly,

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.658
<i>but I've never been able</i>
<i>to refuse your wife anything.</i>

00:28:39.692 --> 00:28:41.826
I won't forget this.

00:28:41.861 --> 00:28:43.928
You're a true friend.

00:28:43.963 --> 00:28:47.231
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.

00:28:51.403 --> 00:28:53.905
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

00:28:53.939 --> 00:28:55.773
He's a child--
10 years old.

00:28:55.807 --> 00:28:58.209
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.

00:28:58.243 --> 00:29:00.845
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

00:29:00.879 --> 00:29:02.747
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing.

00:29:02.781 --> 00:29:04.749
He's said nothing.
He remembers nothing.

00:29:04.783 --> 00:29:06.918
Then what are you raving about?

00:29:06.952 --> 00:29:08.586
What if it comes back to him?

00:29:08.621 --> 00:29:10.422
If he tells his father
what he saw--

00:29:10.456 --> 00:29:12.891
We'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

00:29:12.926 --> 00:29:14.460
We'll say whatever we like.

00:29:14.494 --> 00:29:16.762
I think we can outfox
a 10-year-old.

00:29:16.797 --> 00:29:20.032
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.

00:29:20.067 --> 00:29:22.836
They can write
a ballad about us:

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:25.171
"The War for Cersei's Cunt."

00:29:30.077 --> 00:29:32.079
- Let me go.
- Never.

00:29:32.113 --> 00:29:34.747
- Let me go.
- The boy

00:29:34.782 --> 00:29:37.049
won't talk.

00:29:37.084 --> 00:29:39.085
And if he does, I'll kill him.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.555
Him, Ned Stark, the King--
the whole bloody lot of them,

00:29:42.589 --> 00:29:45.424
until you and I are
the only people

00:29:45.458 --> 00:29:47.659
left in this world.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.104
I wish I could see the girls.

00:30:00.139 --> 00:30:03.374
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

00:30:03.408 --> 00:30:05.676
Until we know
who our enemies are--

00:30:05.711 --> 00:30:07.912
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

00:30:07.946 --> 00:30:09.947
In my bones, I know it.

00:30:09.981 --> 00:30:11.982
Littlefinger's right.

00:30:13.585 --> 00:30:15.887
I can't do anything
without proof.

00:30:15.921 --> 00:30:18.456
And if you find the proof?

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:20.691
Then I bring it to Robert...

00:30:20.726 --> 00:30:23.495
And hope he's still
the man I once knew.

00:30:25.264 --> 00:30:27.265
You watch yourself
on the road, huh?

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.736
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.606
My temper?
Gods be good,

00:30:33.641 --> 00:30:36.409
you nearly killed poor
Littlefinger yesterday.

00:30:41.215 --> 00:30:42.916
He still loves you.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.986
Does he?

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.204
Off with you.

00:31:37.001 --> 00:31:40.470
Yes, it's been a long time.

00:31:40.505 --> 00:31:44.240
But I still remember
every face.

00:31:45.809 --> 00:31:47.943
You remember your first?

00:31:50.347 --> 00:31:52.515
Of course, Your Grace.

00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:54.584
Who was it?

00:31:54.618 --> 00:31:56.753
A Tyroshi.

00:31:56.787 --> 00:31:59.055
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.

00:31:59.089 --> 00:32:01.391
How'd you do it?

00:32:01.426 --> 00:32:03.493
Lance through the heart.

00:32:03.528 --> 00:32:05.363
<i>Quick one.</i>

00:32:06.732 --> 00:32:09.100
Lucky for you.

00:32:09.134 --> 00:32:13.005
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

00:32:14.474 --> 00:32:17.008
<i>My horse took an arrow</i>
<i>so I was on foot,</i>

00:32:17.043 --> 00:32:19.044
<i>slogging through the mud.</i>

00:32:20.346 --> 00:32:25.684
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,

00:32:25.718 --> 00:32:27.887
thinking he could end
the rebellion

00:32:27.921 --> 00:32:30.455
<i>with single swing of his sword.</i>

00:32:31.791 --> 00:32:33.792
<i>I knocked him down</i>
<i>with the hammer.</i>

00:32:33.827 --> 00:32:36.195
<i>Gods, I was strong then.</i>

00:32:36.229 --> 00:32:39.065
Caved in his breastplate.

00:32:39.099 --> 00:32:42.268
Probably shattered
every rib he had.

00:32:42.303 --> 00:32:46.140
<i>Stood over him,</i>
<i>hammer in the air.</i>

00:32:46.174 --> 00:32:50.511
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "Wait!

00:32:50.546 --> 00:32:53.581
Wait."

00:32:57.919 --> 00:33:01.622
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.

00:33:01.656 --> 00:33:06.192
They don't put that part
in the songs.

00:33:08.728 --> 00:33:11.230
Stupid boy.

00:33:12.332 --> 00:33:14.934
<i>Now the Tarlys bend the knee</i>

00:33:14.968 --> 00:33:17.370
<i>like everyone else.</i>

00:33:17.404 --> 00:33:19.539
He could have lingered

00:33:19.573 --> 00:33:22.242
on the edge of the battle
with the smart boys

00:33:22.276 --> 00:33:25.879
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,

00:33:25.914 --> 00:33:28.883
<i>his sons would be ingrates,</i>

00:33:28.917 --> 00:33:31.953
and he'd be waking
three times in the night

00:33:31.987 --> 00:33:34.889
to piss into a bowl.
Wine!

00:33:37.892 --> 00:33:42.496
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.

00:33:43.464 --> 00:33:47.067
Lancel Lannister.

00:33:47.101 --> 00:33:51.271
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?

00:33:53.674 --> 00:33:56.510
What are you doing?

00:33:57.912 --> 00:34:00.447
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean it's empty?

00:34:00.481 --> 00:34:03.316
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?

00:34:05.386 --> 00:34:07.754
So get more.

00:34:11.425 --> 00:34:13.659
Tell your cousin
to get in here.

00:34:13.693 --> 00:34:15.094
Kingslayer!

00:34:15.128 --> 00:34:17.163
Get in here.

00:34:24.603 --> 00:34:27.805
<i>Surrounded by Lannisters.</i>

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:32.076
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:35.379
and their smug,
satisfied faces.

00:34:35.413 --> 00:34:38.181
It must wound your pride, huh?

00:34:38.216 --> 00:34:41.184
Standing out there
like a glorified sentry.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.490
Jaime Lannister,
son of the mighty Tywin...

00:34:47.759 --> 00:34:50.195
Forced to mind the door
while your King

00:34:50.229 --> 00:34:53.198
eats and drinks
and shits and fucks.

00:34:55.101 --> 00:34:56.701
So come on.

00:34:56.736 --> 00:34:58.836
We're telling war stories.

00:35:00.072 --> 00:35:03.708
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

00:35:04.943 --> 00:35:07.578
One of the outlaws
in the Brotherhood.

00:35:07.613 --> 00:35:10.181
I was there that day.

00:35:10.215 --> 00:35:13.384
You were only a squire,
16 years old.

00:35:13.418 --> 00:35:16.320
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

00:35:16.354 --> 00:35:18.622
Best move I ever saw.

00:35:18.656 --> 00:35:22.893
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

00:35:22.927 --> 00:35:25.062
<i>Your outlaw...</i>

00:35:25.097 --> 00:35:27.665
Any last words?

00:35:27.699 --> 00:35:30.534
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmmm.

00:35:30.569 --> 00:35:33.505
What about Aerys Targaryen?

00:35:33.539 --> 00:35:37.475
What did the Mad King say when
you stabbed him in the back?

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.578
I never asked.

00:35:39.612 --> 00:35:42.648
Did he call you a traitor?

00:35:42.682 --> 00:35:45.852
Did he plead for a reprieve?

00:35:47.321 --> 00:35:50.356
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

00:35:52.026 --> 00:35:54.226
"Burn them all."

00:35:58.998 --> 00:36:00.932
If that's all, Your Grace...

00:36:33.196 --> 00:36:35.631
Do the Dothraki buy
their slaves?

00:36:35.665 --> 00:36:37.800
The Dothraki don't
believe in money.

00:36:37.834 --> 00:36:40.135
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

00:36:40.169 --> 00:36:42.404
- From whom?
- If you rule a city

00:36:42.438 --> 00:36:45.373
and you see the horde approaching,
you have two choices:

00:36:45.407 --> 00:36:47.241
Pay tribute or fight.

00:36:47.276 --> 00:36:48.976
An easy choice for most.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:52.513
Of course, sometimes
it's not enough.

00:36:52.547 --> 00:36:55.983
Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by
the number of slaves he's given.

00:36:56.018 --> 00:36:58.586
<i>He might think the men too weak</i>
<i>or the women too ugly.</i>

00:36:58.621 --> 00:37:02.157
Sometimes a Khal decides his riders
haven't had a good fight in months

00:37:02.191 --> 00:37:05.494
- <i>and need the practice.</i>
- <i>Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.</i>

00:37:07.865 --> 00:37:10.633
Tell them all to stop.

00:37:10.668 --> 00:37:12.802
You want the entire
horde to stop?

00:37:12.836 --> 00:37:15.171
For how long?

00:37:15.205 --> 00:37:18.240
Until I command them otherwise.

00:37:18.274 --> 00:37:20.642
You're learning
to talk like a Queen.

00:37:20.677 --> 00:37:22.744
Not a Queen.

00:37:22.779 --> 00:37:24.680
A Khaleesi.

00:37:34.924 --> 00:37:37.460
Annakhas dozgosores.

00:38:01.553 --> 00:38:03.654
You dare!

00:38:03.689 --> 00:38:07.159
You give commands to me?
To <i>me?</i>

00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:12.698
You do not command the dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

00:38:12.732 --> 00:38:15.101
I don't take orders
from savages

00:38:15.135 --> 00:38:17.636
or their sluts.
Do you hear me?

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.842
<i>Hash shafka zali nharees,</i>
<i>zhey Khaleesi?</i>

00:38:22.877 --> 00:38:25.679
Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.

00:38:25.713 --> 00:38:27.181
No.

00:38:27.215 --> 00:38:29.216
<i>Ishish chare acharoe</i>
<i>hash me nem éjervae</i>

00:38:29.251 --> 00:38:32.319
- <i>nharesoon.</i>
- Rakharo say you should take ear,

00:38:32.354 --> 00:38:36.023
- to teach respect.
- Please please, don't hurt him.

00:38:40.028 --> 00:38:43.763
Tell him I don't want
my brother harmed.

00:38:43.797 --> 00:38:46.665
<i>Khaleesi vos zalo</i>
<i>meme nem azisa.</i>

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.101
Huh?

00:38:50.169 --> 00:38:52.837
<i>Shafki.</i>

00:38:56.576 --> 00:39:00.280
Mormont!
Kill these Dothraki dogs!

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.388
I am your King!

00:39:09.425 --> 00:39:12.494
Shall we return
to the Khalasar, khaleesi?

00:39:32.313 --> 00:39:34.647
Uh uh uh uh uh.

00:39:34.681 --> 00:39:37.784
You walk.

00:42:07.978 --> 00:42:12.447
I wanted to be here when you
saw it for the first time.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:23.892
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?

00:42:24.961 --> 00:42:27.195
I'm the First Ranger.

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.498
My job is out there.

00:42:29.532 --> 00:42:32.868
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?

00:42:32.902 --> 00:42:34.803
The kind I don't
want to believe.

00:42:36.439 --> 00:42:38.941
I'm ready.
I won't let you down.

00:42:38.975 --> 00:42:41.510
You're not going.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.748
You're no ranger, Jon.

00:42:45.782 --> 00:42:48.517
- But I'm better than every--
- Better than no one!

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:55.557
Here...

00:42:55.591 --> 00:42:57.926
A man gets what he earns,

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.128
when he earns it.

00:43:04.067 --> 00:43:06.301
We'll speak when I return.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.953
- A bear's balls.
- Oh, you're joking?

00:43:24.987 --> 00:43:28.524
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart

00:43:28.558 --> 00:43:31.060
all fried in his own fat.

00:43:31.094 --> 00:43:33.696
When you're a hundred miles
north of the Wall

00:43:33.731 --> 00:43:37.232
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

00:43:37.267 --> 00:43:40.536
And how do
a bear's balls taste?

00:43:40.571 --> 00:43:42.872
A bit chewy.

00:43:44.975 --> 00:43:48.511
And what about you, My Lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

00:43:48.545 --> 00:43:50.913
Do Dornish girls count?

00:43:54.884 --> 00:43:58.019
So you roam the Seven Kingdoms,

00:43:58.053 --> 00:44:00.254
collaring pickpockets
and horse thieves

00:44:00.288 --> 00:44:02.389
and bringing them here
as eager recruits?

00:44:02.424 --> 00:44:04.224
Aye.

00:44:04.259 --> 00:44:07.260
But it's not all of 'em's
done bad things.

00:44:07.295 --> 00:44:10.296
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.

00:44:10.331 --> 00:44:13.032
Some of 'em's high-born lads
looking for glory.

00:44:13.066 --> 00:44:16.602
They have a better chance finding feed
than glory.

00:44:16.636 --> 00:44:20.172
The Night's Watch is
a joke to you, is it?

00:44:20.206 --> 00:44:22.742
Is that what we are, Lannister?

00:44:22.776 --> 00:44:25.611
An army of jesters in black?

00:44:25.645 --> 00:44:27.780
You don't have enough men
to be an army

00:44:27.814 --> 00:44:31.450
and aside from Yoren here, none
of you are particularly funny.

00:44:31.485 --> 00:44:34.220
<i>I hope we've provided you</i>
<i>with some good stories to tell</i>

00:44:34.255 --> 00:44:36.189
<i>when you're back</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

00:44:36.224 --> 00:44:37.758
But something to think about

00:44:37.792 --> 00:44:39.893
while you're drinking
your wine down there,

00:44:39.928 --> 00:44:41.862
enjoying your brothels--

00:44:41.897 --> 00:44:46.234
Half the boys you've seen training
will die north of the Wall.

00:44:46.269 --> 00:44:49.738
<i>Might be a wilding's axe</i>
<i>that gets them,</i>

00:44:49.772 --> 00:44:52.440
<i>might be sickness,</i>

00:44:52.475 --> 00:44:55.309
might just be the cold.

00:44:55.344 --> 00:44:58.045
They die in pain.

00:44:58.079 --> 00:45:01.615
And they do it so plump
little lords like you

00:45:01.649 --> 00:45:05.118
can enjoy their summer
afternoons in peace and comfort.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.121
Do you think I'm plump?

00:45:12.859 --> 00:45:15.260
Listen, Benjen--
May I call you Benjen?

00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:16.481
<i>Call me what you like.</i>

00:45:16.601 --> 00:45:18.912
<i>I'm not sure what I've</i>
<i>done to offend you.</i>

00:45:19.032 --> 00:45:21.200
I have great admiration
for the Night's Watch.

00:45:21.234 --> 00:45:23.803
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

00:45:23.837 --> 00:45:25.871
You know, my brother
once told me

00:45:25.906 --> 00:45:28.508
that nothing someone says
before the word "but"

00:45:28.542 --> 00:45:30.442
really counts.

00:45:30.477 --> 00:45:32.979
But...

00:45:33.013 --> 00:45:36.248
I don't believe that giants
and ghouls and White Walkers

00:45:36.282 --> 00:45:38.083
are lurking beyond the Wall.

00:45:38.117 --> 00:45:40.485
I believe that
the only difference

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.787
between us and
the wildlings is that

00:45:42.821 --> 00:45:45.156
when the Wall went up,
our ancestors happened

00:45:45.191 --> 00:45:47.424
to live on
the right side of it.

00:45:47.459 --> 00:45:49.359
You're right.

00:45:50.962 --> 00:45:53.063
The wildlings are
no different from us.

00:45:53.097 --> 00:45:55.966
A little rougher maybe.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.769
But they're made
of meat and bone.

00:45:58.804 --> 00:46:01.406
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:05.377
It's not the wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

00:46:06.513 --> 00:46:08.681
You've never been
north of the Wall,

00:46:08.715 --> 00:46:11.117
so don't tell me
what's out there.

00:46:14.622 --> 00:46:16.656
Are you going below?

00:46:18.158 --> 00:46:21.527
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.

00:46:21.562 --> 00:46:24.063
Oh, I always do.

00:46:32.406 --> 00:46:34.674
I think he's starting
to like me.

00:46:37.412 --> 00:46:40.881
- "Going below"?
- Aye.

00:46:40.916 --> 00:46:42.550
Into the tunnel

00:46:42.584 --> 00:46:44.720
and out the other side.

00:46:44.754 --> 00:46:47.490
He'll be north of the Wall
for a month or two.

00:46:49.626 --> 00:46:52.795
So you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.398
Aye, day after tomorrow.

00:46:55.433 --> 00:46:59.236
I get about half of my
recruits from their dungeons.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:03.540
Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.

00:47:03.575 --> 00:47:08.613
I... I travel a bit
on the grubby side, My Lord.

00:47:08.647 --> 00:47:12.651
Not this time. We'll be staying at
the finest castles and inns.

00:47:12.685 --> 00:47:15.420
No one turns away a Lannister.

00:47:20.926 --> 00:47:23.193
At Jakar?

00:47:23.228 --> 00:47:25.028
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

00:47:25.062 --> 00:47:27.297
Ath ja haker.

00:47:27.331 --> 00:47:29.265
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

00:47:29.299 --> 00:47:31.167
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

00:47:31.201 --> 00:47:32.968
Yes, Khaleesi.

00:47:34.738 --> 00:47:36.972
Oh, what are you doing?

00:47:37.007 --> 00:47:39.608
When was last time
you bleed, Khaleesi?

00:47:42.045 --> 00:47:44.079
You change, Khaleesi.

00:47:53.124 --> 00:47:55.993
For a man on horseback,
the curved blade

00:47:56.027 --> 00:47:58.529
is a good thing,
easier to handle.

00:47:58.563 --> 00:48:02.033
It's a good weapon
for a Dothrakan.

00:48:02.067 --> 00:48:04.836
But a man in full plate--

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:06.671
<i>Shori tawakof</i>

00:48:06.706 --> 00:48:09.674
the <i>arakh</i> won't get
through the steel.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:13.011
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

00:48:13.046 --> 00:48:16.048
Designed for piercing plate.

00:48:20.219 --> 00:48:23.454
- Armor.
- Armor.

00:48:23.488 --> 00:48:26.123
Armor make a man...

00:48:26.157 --> 00:48:28.291
- <i>Vroz?</i>
- Slow.

00:48:28.325 --> 00:48:30.259
- Slow.
- It's true,

00:48:30.294 --> 00:48:33.595
but it also keeps a man alive.

00:48:51.516 --> 00:48:54.017
He still is.

00:48:54.052 --> 00:48:56.520
A man of great honor

00:48:56.554 --> 00:48:58.522
and I betrayed him.

00:49:22.147 --> 00:49:24.615
I don't think
she wants to eat dog.

00:49:27.886 --> 00:49:30.654
The Khaleesi
have baby inside her.

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:35.360
<i>It is true.</i>
<i>She does not bleed for two moons.</i>

00:49:35.394 --> 00:49:37.929
<i>Her belly start to swell.</i>

00:49:39.866 --> 00:49:43.769
<i>She does not want to eat horse.</i>

00:49:45.172 --> 00:49:48.075
I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.

00:49:53.248 --> 00:49:55.916
I need to ride to Qohor.

00:49:58.853 --> 00:50:02.856
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.

00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:05.225
Don't worry.
I'll catch you.

00:50:05.259 --> 00:50:07.694
The horde's easy to find.

00:50:18.172 --> 00:50:20.073
Don't stand so still.

00:50:20.107 --> 00:50:23.643
It's harder to hit
a moving target.

00:50:27.815 --> 00:50:30.650
Except for you.
You move too much.

00:50:30.684 --> 00:50:33.386
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

00:50:38.558 --> 00:50:41.526
<i>How many winters have</i>
<i>you seen, Lord Tyrion?</i>

00:50:41.561 --> 00:50:44.195
Eight-- no, nine.

00:50:44.229 --> 00:50:46.764
All of them brief?

00:50:46.798 --> 00:50:50.033
They say the winter of my birth was
three years long, Maester Aemon.

00:50:50.068 --> 00:50:53.103
This summer has lasted nine.

00:50:53.137 --> 00:50:57.473
But reports from the Citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

00:50:57.507 --> 00:50:59.942
The Starks are always
right eventually:

00:50:59.976 --> 00:51:02.945
Winter is coming.

00:51:02.979 --> 00:51:05.780
This one will be long

00:51:05.814 --> 00:51:08.516
and dark things
will come with it.

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:11.619
We've been capturing wildlings,

00:51:11.653 --> 00:51:14.688
more every month.
They're fleeing south.

00:51:14.723 --> 00:51:18.960
<i>The ones who flee say they've seen</i>
<i>the White Walkers.</i>

00:51:18.994 --> 00:51:22.398
Yes, and the fishermen of
Lannisport say they see mermaids.

00:51:22.432 --> 00:51:25.835
One of our own rangers swore he
saw them kill his companions.

00:51:25.869 --> 00:51:27.937
He swore it right up
to the moment

00:51:27.972 --> 00:51:29.873
Ned Stark chopped his head off.

00:51:29.907 --> 00:51:32.543
<i>The Night's Watch</i>
<i>is the only thing</i>

00:51:32.577 --> 00:51:34.611
standing between the realm

00:51:34.646 --> 00:51:36.913
and what lies beyond.

00:51:36.948 --> 00:51:39.149
<i>And it has has become an army</i>

00:51:39.183 --> 00:51:42.785
of undisciplined boys
and tired old men.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.354
There are less than
a thousand of us now.

00:51:46.389 --> 00:51:49.224
We can't man the other
castles on the Wall.

00:51:49.258 --> 00:51:52.360
<i>We can't properly</i>
<i>patrol the wilderness.</i>

00:51:52.394 --> 00:51:56.063
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed

00:51:56.098 --> 00:51:58.733
- and fed.
- Your sister

00:51:58.767 --> 00:52:01.569
sits by the side the King.

00:52:01.604 --> 00:52:04.472
Tell her we need help.

00:52:04.507 --> 00:52:06.842
<i>When winter does come,</i>

00:52:06.876 --> 00:52:10.312
gods help us all
if we're not ready.

00:53:17.049 --> 00:53:19.484
I'm sorry to see
you leave, Lannister.

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.155
It's either me or this cold.

00:53:23.189 --> 00:53:25.557
And <i>it</i> doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

00:53:25.591 --> 00:53:28.560
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way South?

00:53:28.595 --> 00:53:29.828
I expect I will.

00:53:29.862 --> 00:53:31.897
Gods know there aren't
many feather beds

00:53:31.931 --> 00:53:34.065
between here
and King's Landing.

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.234
If you see my brother Bran,

00:53:36.269 --> 00:53:38.804
tell him I miss him.

00:53:38.838 --> 00:53:40.872
Tell him I'd visit if I could.

00:53:40.906 --> 00:53:42.474
Of course.

00:53:42.508 --> 00:53:45.077
He'll never walk again.

00:53:45.111 --> 00:53:46.778
If you're going to be
a cripple,

00:53:46.812 --> 00:53:49.047
it's better to be a rich cripple.

00:53:49.082 --> 00:53:51.550
You take care, Snow.

00:53:51.584 --> 00:53:53.585
Farewell, My Lord.

00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:07.899
You are late, boy.

00:54:09.768 --> 00:54:12.269
<i>Tomorrow you will</i>
<i>be here at midday.</i>

00:54:12.303 --> 00:54:14.537
Who are you?

00:54:14.572 --> 00:54:17.040
Your dancing master,

00:54:17.074 --> 00:54:18.642
<i>Syrio Forel.</i>

00:54:22.747 --> 00:54:24.247
Tomorrow you will catch it.

00:54:24.282 --> 00:54:26.283
Now pick it up.

00:54:28.586 --> 00:54:30.888
That is not the way, boy.

00:54:30.922 --> 00:54:35.093
This is not a greatsword that is
needing two hands to swing it.

00:54:35.127 --> 00:54:39.264
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

00:54:39.299 --> 00:54:41.167
to make you strong.

00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:43.603
Just so.

00:54:43.637 --> 00:54:46.072
One hand is all that is needed.

00:54:47.308 --> 00:54:49.443
Now you are standing all wrong.

00:54:49.477 --> 00:54:51.846
Turn your body sideface.

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.315
Yes.

00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:56.518
So.

00:54:56.552 --> 00:54:58.886
You are skinny.
That is good.

00:54:58.921 --> 00:55:01.923
The target is smaller.

00:55:01.957 --> 00:55:04.025
Now the grip--
Let me see.

00:55:04.059 --> 00:55:06.827
Yes.

00:55:06.862 --> 00:55:09.697
The grip must be delicate.

00:55:10.665 --> 00:55:12.566
What if I drop it?

00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:14.935
The steel must be
part of your arm.

00:55:14.969 --> 00:55:17.705
Can you drop
part of your arm? No.

00:55:17.739 --> 00:55:21.975
Nine years Syrio Forel was first
sword to the Sealord of Braavos.

00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:24.778
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

00:55:24.812 --> 00:55:26.580
I'm a girl.

00:55:26.614 --> 00:55:30.184
Boy, girl--
you are a sword,

00:55:30.218 --> 00:55:33.120
that is all.

00:55:33.154 --> 00:55:35.556
That is the grip.

00:55:35.591 --> 00:55:37.759
You are not holding
a battle-axe.

00:55:37.793 --> 00:55:40.128
- You are holding--
- A needle.

00:55:40.163 --> 00:55:41.163
Ahhh.

00:55:42.832 --> 00:55:45.434
Just so.

00:55:45.469 --> 00:55:48.304
Now we will begin the dance.

00:55:48.339 --> 00:55:49.806
Remember, child,

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.809
this is not the dance of the
Westeros we are learning--

00:55:52.843 --> 00:55:54.978
The knight's dance,

00:55:55.012 --> 00:55:57.413
hacking and hammering.

00:55:57.448 --> 00:56:00.583
This is the Bravo's dance...

00:56:02.086 --> 00:56:04.053
The water dance.

00:56:04.087 --> 00:56:06.322
It is swift

00:56:06.356 --> 00:56:08.624
and sudden.

00:56:10.093 --> 00:56:12.394
All men are made of water,

00:56:12.429 --> 00:56:14.163
do you know this?

00:56:14.197 --> 00:56:16.499
If you pierce them,

00:56:16.533 --> 00:56:20.302
the water leaks out
and they die.

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:24.806
Now you will try to strike me.

00:56:27.843 --> 00:56:29.643
Ha!

00:56:41.357 --> 00:56:42.857
Up!

00:56:46.228 --> 00:56:47.328
Ha!

00:56:58.573 --> 00:56:59.940
Ah.

00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:03.944
Dead.

00:57:03.978 --> 00:57:05.078
Oh!

00:57:05.113 --> 00:57:06.713
Dead.

00:57:06.748 --> 00:57:08.782
<i>Hup!</i>

00:57:11.352 --> 00:57:13.353
Very dead.

00:57:13.387 --> 00:57:15.922
Come.

00:57:15.956 --> 00:57:17.824
Ah ah ah!

00:57:17.858 --> 00:57:20.827
<i>Hup!</i>

00:57:20.861 --> 00:57:22.862
Again, faster.

00:57:27.901 --> 00:57:29.802
Ah.

00:57:33.573 --> 00:57:43.040
