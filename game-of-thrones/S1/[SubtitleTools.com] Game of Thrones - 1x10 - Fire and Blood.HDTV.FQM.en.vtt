00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.937
Look at me.
Look at me!

00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:13.140
Do you remember
me now, boy, eh?

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:15.909
Remember me?
There's a bright boy.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:19.579
You'll be coming
with me, boy,

00:02:19.614 --> 00:02:22.615
and you'll be keeping
your mouth shut.

00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:42.067
- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- I'm not a boy!

00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:45.237
You're not a <i>smart</i> boy,
is that what you're trying to say?

00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:48.007
Do you want
to live, boy?!

00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:53.013
North, boy,
we're going north.

00:03:25.647 --> 00:03:28.382
It had three eyes.

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:31.118
It told me to come
with him, so I did.

00:03:31.152 --> 00:03:34.887
We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

00:03:34.922 --> 00:03:37.757
Your father's not
down there, little lord.

00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:40.059
Not for many years yet.

00:03:41.761 --> 00:03:44.429
You're afraid--
just like Hodor.

00:03:44.464 --> 00:03:46.598
I'm not afraid of some hole
in the ground.

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:49.869
You've lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scared of?

00:03:49.903 --> 00:03:53.039
I'm a crippled boy
and I'm willing to go.

00:03:58.411 --> 00:04:01.179
That's my grandfather
Lord Rickard.

00:04:01.214 --> 00:04:04.516
He was burned alive
by the Mad King Aerys.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.954
That's Lyanna,
my father's sister.

00:04:07.988 --> 00:04:10.890
<i>King Robert was</i>
<i>supposed to marry her,</i>

00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:13.994
<i>but Rhaegar Targaryen</i>
<i>kidnapped her.</i>

00:04:14.028 --> 00:04:16.496
<i>Robert started a war</i>
<i>to win her back.</i>

00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:19.700
<i>He killed Rhaegar,</i>
<i>but she died anyway.</i>

00:04:21.102 --> 00:04:23.270
That's where
I saw father.

00:04:24.738 --> 00:04:28.140
You see?
He's not here.

00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:38.784
-<i>Here, Shaggydog.</i>
-Rickon!

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.719
That beast

00:04:40.754 --> 00:04:43.155
is supposed to be
chained in the kennels!

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.392
- He doesn't like chains.
- What are you doing down here?

00:04:46.426 --> 00:04:49.762
- Come back up with us.
- No, I came to see father.

00:04:49.796 --> 00:04:52.431
How many times have I told you?
He's in King's Landing

00:04:52.466 --> 00:04:54.634
with Sansa and Arya.

00:04:54.668 --> 00:04:57.070
He was down here.
I saw him.

00:04:57.104 --> 00:04:58.838
Saw him when?

00:04:58.872 --> 00:05:00.673
<i>Last night,</i>

00:05:00.707 --> 00:05:03.342
when I was sleeping.

00:05:03.377 --> 00:05:05.877
Here, Shaggydog.

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:12.750
You both miss him.

00:05:12.784 --> 00:05:15.786
It's only natural
he should be in your thoughts

00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:19.623
and dreams,
but that doesn't mean that--

00:05:19.658 --> 00:05:22.427
Bran...

00:05:39.814 --> 00:05:41.915
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:43.750
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

00:05:43.784 --> 00:05:46.252
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

00:05:47.654 --> 00:05:49.388
My Lady.

00:06:37.004 --> 00:06:38.671
Robb.

00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:41.941
Robb.

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:47.880
<i>Robb!</i>

00:06:51.618 --> 00:06:54.253
You've ruined your sword.

00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:06.165
Shh shh.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.934
- Shh.
- I'll kill them all--

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:12.471
--Every one of them.

00:07:12.506 --> 00:07:15.741
I will kill them all.

00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:20.146
My boy.

00:07:21.815 --> 00:07:24.716
They have your sisters.

00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:28.053
We have to get
the girls back.

00:07:30.023 --> 00:07:32.825
And then we will
kill them all.

Very amusing.

00:08:44.903 --> 00:08:47.370
Isn't it a funny song?

00:08:48.572 --> 00:08:50.473
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for your rendition.</i>

00:08:50.507 --> 00:08:53.475
I imagine it was even better
received at that tavern.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.544
I'm so sorry,
Your Grace.

00:08:55.578 --> 00:08:57.545
I'll never sing it again,
I swear.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.714
Tell me,
which do you favor:

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:02.450
<i>Your fingers</i>
<i>or your tongue?</i>

00:09:02.485 --> 00:09:04.152
Your Grace?

00:09:04.187 --> 00:09:06.088
Fingers
or your tongue?

00:09:06.122 --> 00:09:09.258
If you got to keep one,
which would it be?

00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:11.961
I-- I--

00:09:11.995 --> 00:09:14.230
or I could just
cut your throat.

00:09:15.733 --> 00:09:18.067
Every man needs hands,
Your Grace.

00:09:18.102 --> 00:09:19.669
Good.

00:09:19.703 --> 00:09:22.538
- Tongue it is.
- Your Grace, please.

00:09:22.573 --> 00:09:24.640
I won't sing--
Your Grace.

00:09:24.675 --> 00:09:26.809
Ser Ilyn,
who better than you

00:09:26.843 --> 00:09:28.945
- to carry out the sentence?
- I beg you!

00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:30.480
Please no.

00:09:32.283 --> 00:09:33.883
<i>No!</i>

00:09:36.086 --> 00:09:39.021
Your Grace, please.
I beg you, I will never sing again!

00:09:39.056 --> 00:09:40.957
- I'm done for the day.
- <i>No-oooo!</i>

00:09:40.991 --> 00:09:43.603
I'll leave the rest
of the matters to you, mother.

00:09:46.932 --> 00:09:49.433
Your Grace, please!

00:09:56.976 --> 00:09:58.710
You look quite nice.

00:09:58.745 --> 00:10:00.479
Thank you, My Lord.

00:10:00.513 --> 00:10:02.981
"Your Grace."
I'm King now.

00:10:03.015 --> 00:10:06.418
<i>Stop-ppp!</i>
<i>No!</i>

00:10:06.452 --> 00:10:09.220
Walk with me.
I want to show you something.

00:10:13.659 --> 00:10:16.327
Do as you're bid, child.

00:10:22.835 --> 00:10:25.603
...And as soon as you've had
your blood, I'll put a son in you.

00:10:25.637 --> 00:10:28.407
Mother says that
shouldn't be long.

00:10:32.078 --> 00:10:34.580
No, please no!

00:10:34.614 --> 00:10:36.448
This one's your father.

00:10:37.784 --> 00:10:39.685
This one here.

00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:42.154
Look at it and see
what happens to traitors.

00:10:42.188 --> 00:10:46.191
- You promised to be merciful.
- I was.

00:10:46.226 --> 00:10:48.494
I gave him
a clean death.

00:10:49.762 --> 00:10:51.196
Look at him.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.532
Please let me go home.
I won't do any treason, I swear.

00:10:54.566 --> 00:10:58.102
Mother says I'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here

00:10:58.136 --> 00:11:00.805
and obey.

00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:03.140
Look at him!

00:11:11.651 --> 00:11:13.385
<i>Well?</i>

00:11:13.419 --> 00:11:16.322
How long
do I have to look?

00:11:18.158 --> 00:11:20.560
As long as it pleases me.

00:11:23.097 --> 00:11:24.698
Do you want
to see the rest?

00:11:24.732 --> 00:11:26.967
If it please Your Grace.

00:11:27.001 --> 00:11:29.303
That's your Septa there.

00:11:31.239 --> 00:11:32.606
<i>I'll tell you what:</i>

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.975
I'm going to give you
a present.

00:11:35.009 --> 00:11:38.779
After I raise my armies
and kill your traitor brother,

00:11:38.813 --> 00:11:41.281
I'm going to give you
his head as well.

00:11:41.316 --> 00:11:44.017
Or maybe he'll
give me yours.

00:11:49.624 --> 00:11:52.691
My mother tells me a King
should never strike his lady.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.628
Ser Meryn.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.484
Here, girl.

00:12:23.289 --> 00:12:24.889
Will you obey now?

00:12:24.923 --> 00:12:27.458
Or do you need
another lesson?

00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:33.198
I'll look for you
in court.

00:12:35.701 --> 00:12:38.303
Save yourself
some pain, girl.

00:12:38.337 --> 00:12:40.305
Give him what he wants.

00:12:41.407 --> 00:12:44.075
You'll be
needing that again.

00:13:04.965 --> 00:13:07.533
The proper course
is clear:

00:13:07.568 --> 00:13:10.003
Pledge fealty to King Renly
and move south

00:13:10.037 --> 00:13:12.072
to join our forces
with his.

00:13:12.106 --> 00:13:14.841
<i>Renly is not the King.</i>

00:13:14.876 --> 00:13:18.111
You cannot mean
to hold to Joffrey, My Lord.

00:13:18.145 --> 00:13:19.946
He put your father
to death.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.881
That doesn't
make Renly King.

00:13:21.916 --> 00:13:24.651
He's Robert's
<i>youngest</i> brother.

00:13:24.685 --> 00:13:27.787
If Bran can't be Lord
of Winterfell before me,

00:13:27.821 --> 00:13:29.789
<i>Renly can't be King</i>
<i>before Stannis.</i>

00:13:29.823 --> 00:13:31.891
Do you mean to declare us
for Stannis?

00:13:31.925 --> 00:13:33.774
- Renly is not right!
- My Lords.

00:13:33.775 --> 00:13:35.544
If we put ourselves
behind Stannis--

00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:36.769
My Lords!

00:13:37.664 --> 00:13:40.766
Here is what I say
to these two Kings--

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.438
Renly Baratheon
is nothing to me,

00:13:46.473 --> 00:13:48.841
nor Stannis neither.

00:13:48.875 --> 00:13:51.410
Why should they rule
over me and mine

00:13:51.444 --> 00:13:53.579
from some flowery seat
in the South?

00:13:53.613 --> 00:13:57.816
<i>What do they know of the Wall</i>
<i>or the Wolfswood?</i>

00:13:58.718 --> 00:14:00.819
Even their Gods
are wrong!

00:14:04.824 --> 00:14:07.159
Why shouldn't we rule
ourselves again?

00:14:07.193 --> 00:14:10.329
It was the Dragons
we bowed to

00:14:10.363 --> 00:14:13.432
and now the Dragons
are dead!

00:14:14.968 --> 00:14:17.770
There sits the only King

00:14:17.804 --> 00:14:21.040
I mean to bend
my knee to--

00:14:21.074 --> 00:14:23.475
the King
in the North!

00:14:31.151 --> 00:14:32.918
I'll have peace
on those terms.

00:14:32.953 --> 00:14:35.622
<i>They can keep</i>
<i>their Red Castle</i>

00:14:35.656 --> 00:14:38.525
and their Iron Chair too.

00:14:39.894 --> 00:14:41.528
The King
in the North!

00:14:43.364 --> 00:14:46.433
Am I your brother,
now and always?

00:14:46.467 --> 00:14:48.068
Now and always.

00:14:51.841 --> 00:14:54.743
My sword is yours,
in victory and defeat

00:14:54.777 --> 00:14:57.880
from this day
until my last day.

00:14:59.048 --> 00:15:00.482
The King
in the North!

00:15:00.517 --> 00:15:04.420
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

00:15:04.454 --> 00:15:06.956
The King
in the North!

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.858
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

00:15:09.892 --> 00:15:11.959
The King
in the North!

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:14.094
The King in the North!

00:15:14.129 --> 00:15:16.230
The King
in the North!

00:15:16.264 --> 00:15:17.898
<i>The King in the North!</i>

00:15:17.933 --> 00:15:23.904
<i>The King in the North!</i>
<i>The King in the North!</i>

00:15:28.043 --> 00:15:30.778
- Lady Stark.
- I want to see him.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.480
Now!

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:55.102
Leave us.

00:16:01.176 --> 00:16:03.611
You look lovely
tonight, Lady Stark.

00:16:03.645 --> 00:16:06.046
<i>Widowhood becomes you.</i>

00:16:08.416 --> 00:16:10.817
Your bed must be lonely.

00:16:10.852 --> 00:16:12.619
Is that why you came?

00:16:12.654 --> 00:16:15.255
<i>I'm not at my best,</i>

00:16:15.289 --> 00:16:17.491
but I think I could
be of service.

00:16:17.525 --> 00:16:21.361
You slip out of that gown
and we'll see if I'm up to it.

00:16:25.699 --> 00:16:28.868
Oh, I do like
a violent woman.

00:16:28.902 --> 00:16:31.838
I will kill you
tonight, Ser,

00:16:31.873 --> 00:16:35.676
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.211
<i>Let me show you how--</i>

00:16:37.245 --> 00:16:39.747
hit me again,
over the ear.

00:16:39.781 --> 00:16:41.715
And again and again.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.752
You're stronger than you look--
it shouldn't take long.

00:16:44.786 --> 00:16:46.720
That is what you want
the world to believe,

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:48.589
isn't it?
That you don't fear death.

00:16:48.623 --> 00:16:50.457
But I don't, My Lady.

00:16:50.491 --> 00:16:54.027
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?

00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:56.629
Because you are going
to the deepest

00:16:56.664 --> 00:16:59.065
of the Seven Hells,
if the Gods are just.

00:16:59.099 --> 00:17:01.267
What Gods are those?

00:17:01.301 --> 00:17:04.003
The trees your husband
prayed to?

00:17:05.673 --> 00:17:08.608
<i>Where were the trees when his</i>
<i>head was getting chopped off?</i>

00:17:08.642 --> 00:17:11.578
If your Gods are real
and if they are just,

00:17:11.612 --> 00:17:14.747
why is the world
so full of injustice?

00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:19.018
Because of men like you.

00:17:19.053 --> 00:17:21.688
There are no men like me.

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:24.691
Only me.

00:17:29.497 --> 00:17:32.200
My son Bran.

00:17:33.402 --> 00:17:35.803
How did he come to fall
from that tower?

00:17:35.838 --> 00:17:38.406
I pushed him
out the window.

00:17:40.576 --> 00:17:42.410
Why?

00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:46.882
I hoped the fall
would kill him.

00:17:46.916 --> 00:17:48.950
Why?

00:17:56.758 --> 00:17:58.693
You should get some sleep.

00:17:58.727 --> 00:18:01.129
It's going to be
a long war.

00:18:25.557 --> 00:18:28.491
I can't believe
we're actually at war.

00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:32.796
Was it this exciting last time,
when you were young?

00:18:36.301 --> 00:18:38.602
What does it say?

00:18:39.671 --> 00:18:41.738
Have we captured
Robb Stark yet?

00:18:41.773 --> 00:18:44.674
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

00:18:45.943 --> 00:18:47.911
Get back into bed.

00:18:55.752 --> 00:18:57.886
They have my son.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.625
The Stark boy appears
to be less green than we'd hoped.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.929
I've heard his wolf killed a doze
men and as many horses.

00:19:06.963 --> 00:19:08.730
Is it true about
Stannis and Renly?

00:19:08.765 --> 00:19:11.533
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:14.136
Jaime captured,
his armies scattered...

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.071
It's a catastrophe.

00:19:17.106 --> 00:19:19.107
Perhaps we should
sue for peace.

00:19:22.445 --> 00:19:24.714
There's your peace.

00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:28.717
Joffrey saw to that when h
decided to remove Ned Stark's head.

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:32.188
<i>You'll have an easier time</i>
<i>drinking from that cup</i>

00:19:32.222 --> 00:19:35.525
<i>than you will bringing Robb Stark</i>
<i>to the table now.</i>

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:37.060
He's winning...

00:19:37.094 --> 00:19:39.062
in case you
hadn't noticed.

00:19:39.096 --> 00:19:40.597
I'm told we still
have his sisters.

00:19:40.631 --> 00:19:43.266
The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

00:19:43.301 --> 00:19:45.169
No truces.
We can't afford to look weak.

00:19:45.203 --> 00:19:46.804
<i>We should march</i>
<i>on them at once.</i>

00:19:46.838 --> 00:19:49.440
<i>First we must return</i>
<i>to Casterly Rock to raise--</i>

00:19:49.474 --> 00:19:51.942
They have my son!

00:19:54.579 --> 00:19:56.681
Get out, all of you.

00:20:07.159 --> 00:20:09.394
Not you.

00:20:24.276 --> 00:20:27.179
You were right
about Eddard Stark.

00:20:28.981 --> 00:20:31.015
If he were alive,
we could have used him

00:20:31.049 --> 00:20:34.318
to broker a peace
with Winterfell and Riverrun,

00:20:34.353 --> 00:20:36.687
which would have
given us more time

00:20:36.721 --> 00:20:39.557
to deal with Robert's brothers.
But now...

00:20:40.793 --> 00:20:43.828
Madness--
madness and stupidity.

00:20:46.699 --> 00:20:49.835
I always thought
you were a stunted fool.

00:20:51.505 --> 00:20:53.138
Perhaps I was wrong.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.442
Half wrong.

00:20:56.877 --> 00:20:59.213
I'm new to strategy, but--

00:20:59.247 --> 00:21:01.481
unless we want to be
surrounded by three armies,

00:21:01.516 --> 00:21:03.550
<i>it appears we can't</i>
<i>stay here.</i>

00:21:03.585 --> 00:21:05.485
No one will stay here.

00:21:05.519 --> 00:21:08.954
Ser Gregor will head out
with 500 riders

00:21:08.989 --> 00:21:12.892
and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

00:21:12.926 --> 00:21:16.395
The rest of us will
regroup at Harrenhal.

00:21:18.498 --> 00:21:20.633
And you will go
to King's Landing.

00:21:20.667 --> 00:21:22.868
And do what?

00:21:22.903 --> 00:21:24.804
Rule!

00:21:24.838 --> 00:21:27.706
You will serve as Hand
of the King in my stead.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.776
You will bring that boy King to heel
and his mother too, if needs be.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.480
And if you get so much as a whiff
of treason from any of the rest:

00:21:35.515 --> 00:21:38.550
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle--
- Heads, spikes, walls.

00:21:38.585 --> 00:21:41.787
Why not my Uncle?

00:21:41.821 --> 00:21:44.389
Why not anyone?
Why me?

00:21:44.424 --> 00:21:46.992
You're my son.

00:21:54.201 --> 00:21:56.502
Oh, one more thing:

00:21:56.537 --> 00:21:59.939
You will not take
the whore to court.

00:21:59.973 --> 00:22:01.907
Do you understand?

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.795
Ser Jorah?

00:22:27.199 --> 00:22:30.368
Gently gently.

00:22:32.103 --> 00:22:33.837
My son...

00:22:33.871 --> 00:22:36.373
Where is he?
I want him.

00:22:39.009 --> 00:22:40.777
Where is he?

00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:45.115
The boy did not live.

00:22:52.158 --> 00:22:54.926
- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?

00:22:54.961 --> 00:22:57.362
How did my son die?!

00:22:58.798 --> 00:23:01.867
He never lived,
My Princess.

00:23:01.902 --> 00:23:03.969
The women say...

00:23:04.004 --> 00:23:05.771
What do the women say?

00:23:08.341 --> 00:23:11.644
- They say the child was--
- <i>Monstrous,</i>

00:23:11.678 --> 00:23:13.312
twisted.

00:23:13.346 --> 00:23:15.347
I pulled him out
myself.

00:23:16.783 --> 00:23:19.251
He was scaled
like a lizard,

00:23:19.285 --> 00:23:23.655
<i>blind, with leather wings</i>
<i>like the wings of a bat.</i>

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.925
When I touched him
the skin fell from his bones.

00:23:26.959 --> 00:23:30.896
Inside he was
full of graveworms.

00:23:33.166 --> 00:23:37.670
I warned you that only death
can pay for life.

00:23:37.704 --> 00:23:39.839
You knew the price.

00:23:39.873 --> 00:23:42.809
Where is Khal Drogo?

00:23:42.843 --> 00:23:44.944
Show him to me.

00:23:44.978 --> 00:23:47.513
Show me what I bought

00:23:47.547 --> 00:23:50.449
with my son's life.

00:23:50.483 --> 00:23:52.551
As you command, lady.

00:23:52.585 --> 00:23:54.252
Come.

00:23:54.286 --> 00:23:56.087
I will take you
to him.

00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:59.056
- Time enough for that later--
- I want to see him now.

00:24:14.775 --> 00:24:17.010
The Khalasar is gone.

00:24:17.044 --> 00:24:19.646
A Khal who cannot ride
is no Khal.

00:24:19.681 --> 00:24:22.516
The Dothraki
follow only the strong.

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.218
I'm sorry, My Princess.

00:24:37.065 --> 00:24:38.165
Drogo!

00:24:42.303 --> 00:24:44.204
Why is he out here alone?

00:24:44.239 --> 00:24:47.007
He seems to like
the warmth, Princess.

00:24:51.246 --> 00:24:52.980
<i>He lives.</i>

00:24:53.014 --> 00:24:55.816
<i>You asked for life,</i>
<i>you paid for life.</i>

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:59.452
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

00:24:59.487 --> 00:25:01.855
When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.924
<i>when the seas go dry.</i>

00:25:03.958 --> 00:25:07.728
When the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.

00:25:22.879 --> 00:25:24.580
Leave us.

00:25:26.082 --> 00:25:28.317
I don't want you alone
with this sorceress.

00:25:28.352 --> 00:25:31.554
I have nothing more
to fear from this woman.

00:25:32.456 --> 00:25:34.056
Go.

00:25:39.896 --> 00:25:43.232
You knew what I was buying
and you knew the price.

00:25:43.266 --> 00:25:46.134
It was wrong of them
to burn my temple.

00:25:46.169 --> 00:25:50.105
- <i>It angered the Great Shepherd.</i>
- This is not God's work.

00:25:50.139 --> 00:25:52.774
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

00:25:52.808 --> 00:25:56.077
He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.

00:25:56.111 --> 00:25:57.556
Now he will burn no cities.

00:25:57.581 --> 00:26:00.132
Now his Khalasar will trample
no nations into dust.

00:26:00.516 --> 00:26:02.851
I spoke for you.

00:26:02.885 --> 00:26:05.087
I saved you.

00:26:05.121 --> 00:26:07.722
Saved me?

00:26:07.756 --> 00:26:09.857
Three of those riders
had already

00:26:09.892 --> 00:26:12.627
raped me before
you saved me, girl.

00:26:15.731 --> 00:26:18.333
I saw my God's house burn,

00:26:18.367 --> 00:26:22.737
there where I had healed men
and women beyond counting.

00:26:22.771 --> 00:26:25.439
In the streets
I saw piles of heads--

00:26:25.474 --> 00:26:28.009
the head of the Baker
who makes my bread,

00:26:28.043 --> 00:26:29.443
the head of a young boy

00:26:29.478 --> 00:26:32.313
that I had cured of fever
just three moons past.

00:26:32.347 --> 00:26:36.317
So tell me again
exactly what it was

00:26:36.351 --> 00:26:37.719
that you saved.

00:26:37.753 --> 00:26:39.687
Your life.

00:26:39.721 --> 00:26:41.722
Hmph.

00:26:41.757 --> 00:26:44.358
Why don't you take
a look at your Khal...

00:26:46.128 --> 00:26:48.963
Then you will see
exactly what life is worth

00:26:48.997 --> 00:26:51.799
when all the rest has gone.

00:27:04.479 --> 00:27:06.714
You can't!

00:27:06.748 --> 00:27:08.950
Get out of my way, Sam.

00:27:08.984 --> 00:27:11.285
They'll put out the word.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.222
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

00:27:14.256 --> 00:27:17.092
Do you know what happens
to deserters?

00:27:19.995 --> 00:27:21.696
Better than you do.

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.399
What are you going to do?

00:27:24.433 --> 00:27:26.334
I'm gonna find my brother

00:27:26.369 --> 00:27:29.404
and put a sword through
King Joffrey's throat.

00:27:30.573 --> 00:27:33.709
You can't leave us now.
We need you here.

00:27:33.743 --> 00:27:37.746
- Move.
- I won't let you go.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.682
- Move.
- No.

00:27:41.551 --> 00:27:43.418
Hyah!

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.072
Hand of the King?

00:28:01.106 --> 00:28:03.107
So it would seem.

00:28:03.141 --> 00:28:07.645
And your father said you couldn't take
anyone with you to King's Landing.

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:10.615
No, he said I couldn't take <i>you</i>
with me to King's Landing.

00:28:10.649 --> 00:28:12.317
He was very specific
on that point.

00:28:12.351 --> 00:28:14.352
He knew my name?

00:28:14.386 --> 00:28:16.120
What?

00:28:16.154 --> 00:28:18.722
He said, "Don't bring Shae
with you to King's Landing"?

00:28:18.757 --> 00:28:21.858
I believe he used
the word "whore."

00:28:23.027 --> 00:28:24.994
Are you ashamed of me?

00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:28.064
Are you afraid that I'm dancing
around the court with my tits out?

00:28:28.098 --> 00:28:31.200
I'm funny now?

00:28:31.235 --> 00:28:33.436
I'm Shae the funny whore.

00:28:34.905 --> 00:28:37.907
My father's probably the most
powerful man in the country.

00:28:37.941 --> 00:28:39.208
Certainly the richest.

00:28:39.243 --> 00:28:41.844
<i>He has all Seven Kingdoms</i>
<i>in his pockets.</i>

00:28:41.878 --> 00:28:43.679
Everyone everywhere

00:28:43.713 --> 00:28:46.849
always has to do exactly
what my father says.

00:28:48.318 --> 00:28:50.286
He's always been a cunt.

00:28:57.228 --> 00:28:58.895
I believe the ladies
of the court

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.032
<i>could learn a great deal</i>
<i>from a girl like you.</i>

00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:06.003
Why don't you
come with me,

00:29:06.037 --> 00:29:08.772
<i>be the Hand's lady?</i>

00:29:10.308 --> 00:29:12.976
Because the King needs
a Hand and the Hand--

00:29:17.348 --> 00:29:20.084
I know what
a Hand needs.

00:29:33.098 --> 00:29:35.033
- Ghost?
- <i>Hyah!</i>

00:29:35.067 --> 00:29:37.936
- Hyah.
- Hyah!

00:29:41.341 --> 00:29:42.975
Hyah.

00:29:45.612 --> 00:29:48.514
<i>Samwell!</i>

00:29:49.783 --> 00:29:52.418
<i>- Is he dead?</i>
<i>- No, he's not dead.</i>

00:29:52.452 --> 00:29:54.020
<i>Did we get him?</i>

00:29:54.054 --> 00:29:56.155
<i>Come on, help me</i>
<i>get him up.</i>

00:29:58.459 --> 00:30:01.694
Lucky you've got
plenty of padding.

00:30:03.564 --> 00:30:05.565
We're taking you back
to where you belong.

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:08.201
- I belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.

00:30:08.235 --> 00:30:10.503
They'll kill you if they find out
you've gone.

00:30:10.537 --> 00:30:12.638
They'll kill you if they know
you came after me.

00:30:12.673 --> 00:30:15.675
- Go back.
- Sam told us everything.

00:30:15.709 --> 00:30:18.578
- <i>We're sorry about your father.</i>
- But it doesn't matter.

00:30:18.612 --> 00:30:20.847
You took the oath.
You can't leave.

00:30:20.881 --> 00:30:23.016
- I have to.
- You can't.

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.552
- You said the words.
- I don't care about--

00:30:25.587 --> 00:30:28.722
"Hear my words and bear
witness to my vow..."

00:30:28.757 --> 00:30:30.694
To hell with all of you.

00:30:30.719 --> 00:30:33.041
"Night gathers and now
my Watch begins.

00:30:33.195 --> 00:30:36.531
It shall not end
until my death.

00:30:36.565 --> 00:30:38.332
I shall live and die
at my post."

00:30:38.367 --> 00:30:40.268
"I am the sword
in the darkness..."

00:30:40.302 --> 00:30:42.336
"...The Watcher on the Walls,

00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:44.773
the shield that guards
the realms of men.

00:30:44.807 --> 00:30:48.510
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch,

00:30:48.544 --> 00:30:52.647
for this night
and all nights to come."

00:32:35.718 --> 00:32:38.887
When the sun

00:32:38.922 --> 00:32:41.323
rises in the west

00:32:41.358 --> 00:32:44.793
and sets in the east...

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:51.499
Then you shall return
to me, my sun and stars.

00:33:58.734 --> 00:34:01.169
Kings?

00:34:01.203 --> 00:34:05.273
Oh, I can tell you all
there is to know about Kings.

00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:10.445
The thing you need to
understand about Kings is...

00:34:15.118 --> 00:34:19.021
For the past 67 years,
I've known--

00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:24.127
truly known more Kings
than any man alive.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:30.199
They're complicated men,
but I know how to serve them.

00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:32.135
Yes.

00:34:32.169 --> 00:34:34.771
And keep on serving them.

00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:39.777
Aerys Targaryen...

00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:45.282
of all the thousand thousand
maladies the Gods visit on us,

00:34:45.316 --> 00:34:49.018
madness is the worst.

00:34:49.953 --> 00:34:51.954
He was a good man,

00:34:51.988 --> 00:34:55.157
such a charmer.

00:34:56.259 --> 00:34:59.328
To watch him melt away
before my eyes,

00:34:59.362 --> 00:35:01.396
consumed by dreams

00:35:01.431 --> 00:35:04.599
of fire and blood...

00:35:07.303 --> 00:35:09.605
Robert Baratheon

00:35:09.639 --> 00:35:12.574
was an entirely different animal--
powerful man,

00:35:12.609 --> 00:35:14.744
a great warrior--

00:35:14.778 --> 00:35:17.747
but alas,
winning a Kingdom

00:35:17.781 --> 00:35:21.718
and ruling a Kingdom
are rather different things.

00:35:21.752 --> 00:35:24.053
They say that

00:35:24.121 --> 00:35:27.523
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

00:35:27.557 --> 00:35:29.858
he can often be blind

00:35:29.892 --> 00:35:32.728
to the enemies at his side.

00:35:34.663 --> 00:35:38.366
Now I serve his son

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.634
King Joffrey,

00:35:40.669 --> 00:35:42.870
may the Gods
bless his reign.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.943
He is a capable young man--
strong military mind.

00:35:47.977 --> 00:35:51.213
Stern...

00:35:51.247 --> 00:35:55.218
But sternness in defense
of the realm is no vice.

00:35:56.687 --> 00:35:59.889
It's far too soon to know what
manner of King he will be,

00:35:59.924 --> 00:36:01.524
but I sense

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:06.595
true greatness on the horizon
for our new King.

00:36:08.665 --> 00:36:11.066
True greatness.

00:36:15.305 --> 00:36:17.438
So what's the thing?

00:36:19.208 --> 00:36:20.908
What thing?

00:36:20.976 --> 00:36:22.610
About Kings.

00:36:22.645 --> 00:36:25.780
You said, "the thing you need
to understand about Kings..."

00:36:26.648 --> 00:36:28.549
What? Things?
What?

00:36:28.583 --> 00:36:31.385
When you started, you--
never mind.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.455
Let me see you
out, my dear.

00:36:35.489 --> 00:36:38.392
- It's all right. No need.
- <i>Yes yes.</i>

00:36:38.426 --> 00:36:40.860
Till the next time.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.748
Right.

00:37:28.709 --> 00:37:32.178
When you imagine yourself up
there, how do you look?

00:37:32.213 --> 00:37:36.383
Does the crown fit?
Do all the lords and ladies

00:37:36.417 --> 00:37:40.253
simper and bow, the ones who
sneered at you for years?

00:37:40.287 --> 00:37:43.589
It's hard for them to simper
and bow without heads.

00:37:44.891 --> 00:37:47.393
A man with great ambition
and no morals--

00:37:47.428 --> 00:37:49.795
I wouldn't
bet against you.

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:51.631
And what would you do,
my friend,

00:37:51.665 --> 00:37:54.033
if you found yourself
sitting up there?

00:37:55.969 --> 00:37:57.936
I must be one of the few men
in this city

00:37:57.971 --> 00:37:59.605
who doesn't
want to be King.

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:01.674
You must be one
of the few men in the city

00:38:01.708 --> 00:38:03.042
who isn't a man.

00:38:03.077 --> 00:38:04.945
Oh, you can do
better than that.

00:38:09.283 --> 00:38:12.585
When they castrated you, did they
take the pillar with the stones?

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.554
- I've always wondered.
- Have you?

00:38:14.588 --> 00:38:17.591
Do you spend a lot of time wondering
what's between my legs?

00:38:17.625 --> 00:38:20.727
I picture a gash

00:38:20.761 --> 00:38:23.196
like a woman's.
Is that about right?

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:26.065
I am flattered, of course,
to be pictured at all.

00:38:26.099 --> 00:38:29.668
Must be strange for you,
even after all these years--

00:38:29.703 --> 00:38:32.738
a man from another land,

00:38:32.772 --> 00:38:35.440
despised by most,

00:38:35.475 --> 00:38:36.908
feared by all--

00:38:36.943 --> 00:38:38.510
am I?
That is good to know.

00:38:38.544 --> 00:38:41.813
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

00:38:41.847 --> 00:38:45.750
But you carry on,
whispering in one King's ear

00:38:45.784 --> 00:38:48.386
and then the next.

00:38:50.489 --> 00:38:52.357
I admire you.

00:38:52.392 --> 00:38:55.060
And I admire you,
Lord Baelish.

00:38:55.094 --> 00:38:58.097
A grasper from a minor house
with a major talent

00:38:58.131 --> 00:39:00.266
<i>for befriending</i>
<i>powerful men--</i>

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.397
and women.

00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:03.148
A useful talent,
I'm sure you'd agree.

00:39:05.872 --> 00:39:09.241
So here we stand...

00:39:09.275 --> 00:39:12.477
In mutual admiration
and respect.

00:39:12.512 --> 00:39:14.679
Playing our roles.

00:39:14.714 --> 00:39:16.581
Serving a new King.

00:39:16.615 --> 00:39:18.550
Long may he reign.

00:39:18.584 --> 00:39:20.819
- My King.
- My King.

00:39:22.221 --> 00:39:25.190
My Lords.
Shall we begin?

00:39:26.259 --> 00:39:28.227
<i>You're Arry now, hear me?</i>

00:39:28.261 --> 00:39:30.496
Arry the orphan boy.

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:32.798
No one asks an orphan
too many questions

00:39:32.832 --> 00:39:35.034
'cause nobody gives
three shits.

00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:36.369
What's your name?

00:39:36.403 --> 00:39:38.171
- Arry.
- Ah.

00:39:38.206 --> 00:39:41.775
We have a long way
to travel and in bad company.

00:39:41.809 --> 00:39:43.977
I have 20 this time,

00:39:44.011 --> 00:39:46.079
men and boys all
bound for the Wall.

00:39:46.113 --> 00:39:49.816
Your Lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:52.985
and I didn't find
no little lordlings down there.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.256
This lot, half of them would
turn you over to the King

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:58.391
quick as spit for a pardon.

00:39:58.425 --> 00:40:00.460
And the other half
would do the same,

00:40:00.494 --> 00:40:02.696
except they'd
rape you first.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:05.031
So keep to yourself--
and when you piss,

00:40:05.066 --> 00:40:07.233
do it in the woods alone.

00:40:08.869 --> 00:40:10.936
You stay
with this lot, boy.

00:40:10.971 --> 00:40:12.571
And stay--

00:40:12.606 --> 00:40:16.442
or I'll lock you in the back of
the wagon with these three.

00:40:20.313 --> 00:40:22.114
Watch yourself,
midget.

00:40:23.416 --> 00:40:25.384
He's got a sword,
this one.

00:40:25.419 --> 00:40:27.921
What's a gutter rat
like you doing with a sword?

00:40:27.955 --> 00:40:31.158
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

00:40:31.192 --> 00:40:32.793
He looks like a girl.

00:40:32.827 --> 00:40:35.028
I bet he stole
that sword.

00:40:35.063 --> 00:40:37.697
Let's have a look.

00:40:40.067 --> 00:40:41.968
I could use me
a sword like that.

00:40:42.003 --> 00:40:44.237
- <i>Take it off him.</i>
- Give it here, midget.

00:40:44.271 --> 00:40:45.438
Look at him!

00:40:45.473 --> 00:40:47.573
You'd better give
Hot Pie the sword.

00:40:47.608 --> 00:40:49.309
I've seen him
kick a boy to death.

00:40:49.343 --> 00:40:51.711
I knocked him down
and I kicked him in the balls

00:40:51.745 --> 00:40:54.113
and I kept kicking him
until he was dead.

00:40:54.148 --> 00:40:57.583
I kicked him
all to pieces.

00:40:57.617 --> 00:41:00.653
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

00:41:00.687 --> 00:41:02.521
I'll give it to you.

00:41:02.556 --> 00:41:05.258
I already killed
one fat boy.

00:41:05.292 --> 00:41:07.526
I bet you never
killed anyone.

00:41:07.561 --> 00:41:10.596
I bet you're a liar.
But I'm not.

00:41:10.631 --> 00:41:12.398
I'm good at killing
fat boys.

00:41:12.432 --> 00:41:14.734
I like killing fat boys.

00:41:16.136 --> 00:41:18.371
Oh, you like picking
on the little ones, do you?

00:41:18.405 --> 00:41:21.241
You know, I've been hammering
an anvil these past 10 years.

00:41:21.275 --> 00:41:24.311
When I hit
that steel, it sings.

00:41:24.345 --> 00:41:26.646
Are you gonna sing
when I hit you?

00:41:33.287 --> 00:41:35.521
This is
castle-forged steel.

00:41:35.555 --> 00:41:37.689
Where'd you steal it?

00:41:37.724 --> 00:41:40.158
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

00:41:40.193 --> 00:41:42.794
Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.

00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:45.931
They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen--

00:41:45.965 --> 00:41:48.033
murderers.

00:41:48.067 --> 00:41:51.570
- Which are you?
- Armorer's apprentice.

00:41:52.906 --> 00:41:55.574
But my master
got sick of me,

00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:56.876
so here I am.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:59.912
<i>Come on, you sorry</i>
<i>sons of whores!</i>

00:41:59.947 --> 00:42:03.248
It's a thousand leagues
from here to the Wall

00:42:03.282 --> 00:42:05.917
and winter is coming!

00:42:36.449 --> 00:42:38.383
Ham.

00:42:38.418 --> 00:42:40.886
How many days in a row
must a man be

00:42:40.921 --> 00:42:43.523
expected to start
his day with ham?

00:42:43.557 --> 00:42:46.526
Bring me some beer
at least.

00:42:48.562 --> 00:42:50.497
You look exhausted.

00:42:50.531 --> 00:42:52.766
Was your moonlight ride
that tiring?

00:42:56.404 --> 00:42:58.271
Don't look so terrified.

00:42:58.306 --> 00:43:01.175
If we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

00:43:01.209 --> 00:43:03.744
only ghosts
would guard the Wall.

00:43:03.778 --> 00:43:07.315
At least you weren't
whoring in Mole's Town.

00:43:08.283 --> 00:43:10.051
Honor made you leave,

00:43:10.085 --> 00:43:11.887
honor brought you back.

00:43:12.855 --> 00:43:15.056
My friends
brought me back.

00:43:15.091 --> 00:43:17.827
I didn't say
it was your honor.

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:19.796
They killed my father.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.599
And you're going to bring him
back to life, are you?

00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:24.968
No? Good.

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:27.804
We've had enough
of that sort of thing.

00:43:28.972 --> 00:43:30.873
Beyond the Wall,
the rangers are

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:33.375
reporting whole villages
abandoned.

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:36.779
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

00:43:36.813 --> 00:43:38.880
from dusk until dawn.

00:43:38.914 --> 00:43:43.551
A captured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

00:43:43.586 --> 00:43:47.189
<i>to what ends</i>
<i>the Gods only know.</i>

00:43:47.223 --> 00:43:49.457
Outside Eastwatch

00:43:49.492 --> 00:43:52.861
Cotter Pyke's men discovered four
blue-eyed corpses.

00:43:52.895 --> 00:43:57.298
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

00:43:59.234 --> 00:44:02.370
Do you think
your brother's war

00:44:02.404 --> 00:44:04.905
is more important
than ours?

00:44:06.074 --> 00:44:09.644
- No.
- When dead men and worse

00:44:09.678 --> 00:44:12.580
come hunting for us in the night,
do you think it matters

00:44:12.614 --> 00:44:15.117
<i>who sits</i>
<i>on the Iron Throne?</i>

00:44:15.151 --> 00:44:17.586
- No.
- Good.

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.490
Because I want you
and your wolf with us

00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:23.726
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

00:44:24.728 --> 00:44:26.862
Beyond the Wall?

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:28.631
I'll not sit meekly by

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:30.599
and wait for the snows.

00:44:30.634 --> 00:44:33.035
<i>I mean to find out</i>
<i>what's happening.</i>

00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:35.738
<i>The Night's Watch will</i>
<i>ride in force</i>

00:44:35.773 --> 00:44:38.374
<i>against the wildlings,</i>
<i>the White Walkers</i>

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:40.410
<i>and whatever else</i>
<i>is out there.</i>

00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:45.749
<i>And we will find Benjen Stark,</i>

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:47.985
<i>alive or dead.</i>

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:51.255
<i>I will command them</i>
<i>myself.</i>

00:44:51.289 --> 00:44:53.490
<i>So I'll only ask you once,</i>
<i>Lord Snow...</i>

00:44:53.525 --> 00:44:56.160
<i>Move out!</i>

00:44:56.194 --> 00:44:58.863
<i>...Are you a brother</i>
<i>of the Night's Watch</i>

00:44:58.897 --> 00:45:02.700
<i>or a bastard boy</i>
<i>who wants to play at war?</i>

00:45:45.311 --> 00:45:48.746
Drogo will have no use for
dragon eggs in the Night Lands.

00:45:48.781 --> 00:45:51.916
Sell them. You can return
to the Free Cities

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:54.285
and live as a wealthy woman
for all your days.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.821
They were not
given to me to sell.

00:46:02.294 --> 00:46:04.862
Khaleesi, My Queen,

00:46:04.897 --> 00:46:08.233
I vow to serve you,
obey you,

00:46:08.267 --> 00:46:10.602
to die for you
if need be,

00:46:10.636 --> 00:46:13.405
but let him go,
Khaleesi.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.208
I know what you intend.
Do not.

00:46:16.243 --> 00:46:19.078
I must.

00:46:19.112 --> 00:46:21.213
You don't understand--

00:46:21.281 --> 00:46:24.750
don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

00:46:24.784 --> 00:46:27.286
I won't watch you burn.

00:46:28.923 --> 00:46:31.091
Is that what you fear?

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.812
You will be my Khalasar.

00:46:52.846 --> 00:46:56.282
I see the faces of slaves.

00:46:56.316 --> 00:46:58.951
I free you.

00:46:58.985 --> 00:47:03.689
Take off your collars. Go if yo
wish, no one will stop you.

00:47:03.723 --> 00:47:06.192
But if you stay,

00:47:06.226 --> 00:47:09.896
it will be as
brothers and sisters,

00:47:09.964 --> 00:47:13.566
<i>as husbands and wives.</i>

00:47:24.277 --> 00:47:26.812
Ser Jorah, bind this woman
to the pyre.

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:31.785
You swore to obey me.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:43.399
I am Daenerys Stormborn

00:47:43.433 --> 00:47:46.201
of House Targaryen

00:47:46.235 --> 00:47:48.470
of the blood of Old Valyria.

00:47:48.504 --> 00:47:51.106
I am the Dragon's daughter.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.575
And I swear to you

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:57.180
that those who would harm you
will die screaming.

00:47:57.214 --> 00:47:59.082
You will not
hear me scream.

00:47:59.116 --> 00:48:01.150
I will.

00:48:03.121 --> 00:48:05.655
But it is not
your screams I want.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:08.192
Only your life.

00:50:38.409 --> 00:50:41.278
Blood of my blood.

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:35.755
