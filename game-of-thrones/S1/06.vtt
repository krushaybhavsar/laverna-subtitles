00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.127
Your pardon, Your Grace.

00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:29.262
I would rise, but...

00:02:29.296 --> 00:02:31.698
<i>Do you know what</i>
<i>your wife has done?</i>

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:35.202
She did nothing
I did not command.

00:02:35.236 --> 00:02:36.970
Who'd have thought
she had it in her?

00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:39.039
By what right dare you lay
hands on my blood?

00:02:39.074 --> 00:02:40.634
I am the King's Hand, charged
with keeping the peace...

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.261
You <i>were</i> the King's Hand.

00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:44.279
You shall now be held
accountable.

00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:46.315
Oh, will both of you
shut your mouths?!

00:02:48.618 --> 00:02:51.954
Catelyn will release Tyrion and
you'll make your peace with Jaime.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.689
He butchered my men--

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:56.192
Lord Stark was
returning drunk

00:02:56.226 --> 00:02:58.660
from a brothel
when his men attacked Jaime.

00:02:58.694 --> 00:03:02.264
- Quiet, woman.
- <i>Jaime has fled the city.</i>

00:03:02.298 --> 00:03:05.233
Give me leave to bring him
back to justice.

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.004
I took you for a King.

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:11.106
- Hold your tongue.
- <i>He's attacked</i>

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.275
one of my brothers
and abducted the other.

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:15.677
I should wear the armor
and you the gown.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:30.091
I shall wear this
like a badge of honor.

00:03:33.195 --> 00:03:36.464
Wear it in silence
or I'll honor you again.

00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:52.712
See what she does to me?

00:03:52.746 --> 00:03:55.715
My loving wife.

00:04:01.422 --> 00:04:03.757
I should not have
hit her.

00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:05.893
That was not...

00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:09.196
That was not Kingly.

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:13.635
If we don't act,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.971
there will be a war.

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:19.874
So tell your wife to return
that little shit of an Imp

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.310
to King's Landing.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:25.013
She's had her fun,
now put an end to it.

00:04:26.483 --> 00:04:29.318
You hear me?
Send a raven and put an end to it.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.154
And what about
Jaime Lannister?

00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:37.460
- What about Jaime?
- I'm half a Kingdom in debt

00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:39.862
to his bloody father.

00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:43.800
I don't know what happened between
you and those yellow-haired shits.

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:46.570
I don't want to know.
This is what matters--

00:04:46.604 --> 00:04:48.639
I can't rule the Kingdoms

00:04:48.673 --> 00:04:51.675
if the Starks and the Lannisters
are at each other's throats.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.944
So enough.

00:04:55.714 --> 00:04:58.283
As you command,
Your Grace.

00:04:58.317 --> 00:05:00.786
With your leave,

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.955
I will return to Winterfell
and set matters straight.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.891
Piss on that.
Send a raven.

00:05:05.925 --> 00:05:07.559
I want you to stay.

00:05:07.593 --> 00:05:10.663
I'm the King.
I get what I want.

00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:18.870
I never loved my brothers.

00:05:18.905 --> 00:05:22.608
A sad thing for a man
to admit, but it's true.

00:05:26.113 --> 00:05:28.481
You were the brother
I chose.

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:37.324
We'll talk when I return
from the hunt.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.294
The hunt?

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:44.732
Killing things
clears my head.

00:05:44.767 --> 00:05:47.502
You'll have to sit on the
throne while I'm away.

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:50.238
You'll hate it more than I do.

00:05:50.272 --> 00:05:52.006
The Targaryen girl--

00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:55.609
seven hells,
don't start with her again.

00:05:55.643 --> 00:05:58.479
The girl will die
and I'll hear no more of it.

00:05:58.513 --> 00:06:01.549
Put on the badge.
And if you ever take it off again,

00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:05.686
I swear to the mother I'll pin the
damned thing on Jaime Lannister.

00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:29.225
Khaleesi?

00:07:31.662 --> 00:07:33.596
Oh, Khaleesi!

00:07:44.743 --> 00:07:46.578
You're hurt.

00:08:40.031 --> 00:08:43.467
- Not too fast.
- Come on, Dancer.

00:08:43.501 --> 00:08:45.368
When are you gonna
tell him?

00:08:45.403 --> 00:08:47.471
Not now.

00:08:47.505 --> 00:08:49.273
- Blood for blood.
- Bran: Come on!

00:08:49.307 --> 00:08:51.808
You need to make the Lannisters
pay for Jory and the others.

00:08:51.842 --> 00:08:54.144
- Robb: <i>You're talking about war.</i>
- <i>I'm talking about justice.</i>

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:56.413
Only the Lord of Winterfell

00:08:56.447 --> 00:08:58.415
can call in the bannermen
and raise an army.

00:08:58.449 --> 00:09:00.717
A Lannister put his spear
through your father's leg.

00:09:00.752 --> 00:09:03.754
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock
where no one can touch him--

00:09:03.789 --> 00:09:05.657
you want me to march
on Casterly Rock?

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:07.959
- You're not a boy anymore.
- Bran: <i>Come on.</i>

00:09:07.993 --> 00:09:10.962
They attacked your father.
They've already started the war.

00:09:10.996 --> 00:09:15.200
It's your duty to represent your
House when your father can't.

00:09:15.235 --> 00:09:18.871
And it's not your duty,
because it's not your House.

00:09:28.881 --> 00:09:30.982
Where's Bran?

00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:36.087
I don't know.
It's not my House.

00:10:08.553 --> 00:10:11.222
Robb?

00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:14.559
All alone in the deep,
dark woods.

00:10:17.563 --> 00:10:19.697
I'm not alone.
My brother is with me.

00:10:19.731 --> 00:10:21.432
I don't see him.

00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:23.434
Got him hidden
under your cloak?

00:10:23.468 --> 00:10:25.670
Ooh, that's a pretty pin.

00:10:25.704 --> 00:10:28.339
- Silver.
- We'll take the pin

00:10:28.373 --> 00:10:31.642
and the horse.
Get down.

00:10:33.245 --> 00:10:34.711
Be quick about it.

00:10:34.746 --> 00:10:36.180
I can't.

00:10:36.214 --> 00:10:38.282
The saddle--
the straps.

00:10:41.719 --> 00:10:44.788
What's wrong with you?
You some kind of cripple?

00:10:44.823 --> 00:10:46.491
I'm Brandon Stark
of Winterfell.

00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:48.760
If you don't let me be,
I'll have you all killed!

00:10:48.794 --> 00:10:51.429
Cut his little cock off
and stuff it in his mouth.

00:10:51.464 --> 00:10:53.832
The boy's
worth nothing dead.

00:10:53.866 --> 00:10:56.067
Benjen Stark's
own blood?

00:10:56.102 --> 00:10:59.371
<i>Think what Mance</i>
<i>would give us.</i>

00:10:59.405 --> 00:11:02.775
Piss on Mance Rayder
and piss on the North.

00:11:02.809 --> 00:11:06.011
We're going as far South
as South goes.

00:11:06.045 --> 00:11:09.581
There ain't no White Walkers
down in Dorne.

00:11:09.616 --> 00:11:11.917
Drop the knife!

00:11:11.951 --> 00:11:14.920
Let him go and I'll let you live.

00:11:34.906 --> 00:11:36.907
Robb.

00:11:36.942 --> 00:11:39.844
- Robb.
- Shut up.

00:11:39.878 --> 00:11:42.179
Drop the blade!

00:11:42.214 --> 00:11:44.315
- No, don't.
- Do it.

00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:24.720
Are you all right?

00:12:24.754 --> 00:12:27.490
Yes.
It doesn't hurt.

00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:30.393
Tough little lad.

00:12:30.427 --> 00:12:33.930
<i>In the Iron Islands, you're not a man</i>
<i>until you've killed your first enemy.</i>

00:12:33.964 --> 00:12:35.565
Well done.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.467
Have you lost your mind?

00:12:38.502 --> 00:12:40.303
What if you'd missed?

00:12:40.337 --> 00:12:42.738
He would have killed you
and cut Bran's throat.

00:12:42.772 --> 00:12:45.374
- You don't have the right--
- To what, to save your brother's life?

00:12:45.408 --> 00:12:48.276
It was the only thing
to do, so I did it.

00:12:50.112 --> 00:12:52.046
What about her?

00:12:57.853 --> 00:13:00.889
Give me my life,
My Lord, and I'm yours.

00:13:02.758 --> 00:13:04.659
We'll keep her alive.

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:30.384
Mord!

00:13:30.418 --> 00:13:33.654
Turnkey!
Mord!

00:13:34.956 --> 00:13:37.091
Mord!

00:13:40.897 --> 00:13:43.032
Dwarf man
making noise!

00:13:45.602 --> 00:13:47.336
How would you like
to be rich?

00:13:47.371 --> 00:13:49.872
Dwarf man still
making noise.

00:13:50.775 --> 00:13:52.442
My family is rich.

00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:54.210
We have gold,
lots of gold.

00:13:54.245 --> 00:13:56.779
I'm prepared to give you
lots of gold in--

00:13:59.283 --> 00:14:01.317
No gold!

00:14:01.351 --> 00:14:03.352
Well, I don't
have it here.

00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:05.788
No gold.

00:14:05.822 --> 00:14:07.523
Fuck off.

00:14:33.451 --> 00:14:35.686
I don't want
to practice today.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.054
No?

00:14:38.089 --> 00:14:40.491
They killed Jory.

00:14:40.525 --> 00:14:43.427
My father is hurt.

00:14:43.462 --> 00:14:45.963
I don't care about
stupid wooden swords.

00:14:45.998 --> 00:14:47.831
You are troubled.

00:14:47.866 --> 00:14:49.533
- Yes.
- <i>Good!</i>

00:14:49.567 --> 00:14:51.802
Trouble is the perfect
time for training.

00:14:51.837 --> 00:14:55.139
When you are dancing in the meadow
with your dolls and kittens,

00:14:55.174 --> 00:14:57.108
this is not
when fighting happens.

00:14:57.143 --> 00:14:59.411
I don't like
dolls and k--

00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:02.347
<i>You're not here.</i>

00:15:03.316 --> 00:15:05.351
<i>You're with</i>
<i>your trouble.</i>

00:15:05.385 --> 00:15:08.120
If you are with your trouble
when fighting happens--

00:15:12.226 --> 00:15:13.994
--More trouble for you.

00:15:14.028 --> 00:15:16.229
<i>Just so.</i>

00:15:17.598 --> 00:15:20.299
How can you be
quick as a snake...

00:15:24.238 --> 00:15:26.505
...Or as quiet
as a shadow...

00:15:30.777 --> 00:15:33.579
...When you are
somewhere else?

00:15:36.082 --> 00:15:38.217
You are fearing
for your father, hmm?

00:15:40.386 --> 00:15:42.721
That is right.

00:15:42.756 --> 00:15:45.991
- Do you pray to the gods?
- The old and the new.

00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:50.330
There is only one God

00:15:50.364 --> 00:15:53.267
and his name is Death.

00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:56.303
And there is only one thing
we say to Death:

00:15:57.438 --> 00:15:59.406
"Not today."

00:16:07.683 --> 00:16:10.018
<i>Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!</i>

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.621
- Priestess: Khalakka Dothrae!
- <i>Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!</i>

00:16:12.655 --> 00:16:15.056
- <i>Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!</i>
- <i>Khalakka Dothrae!</i>

00:16:24.833 --> 00:16:26.900
She has to eat
the whole heart?

00:16:27.869 --> 00:16:29.736
I hope that wasn't
my horse.

00:16:29.771 --> 00:16:31.605
She's doing well.

00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:33.640
She'll never
keep it down.

00:16:33.675 --> 00:16:35.809
Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!

00:16:35.844 --> 00:16:38.345
<i>Khalakka Dothrae!</i>

00:16:55.031 --> 00:16:55.097
<i>Khalakka Dothrae!</i>

00:16:57.066 --> 00:16:58.967
Tell me what she's saying.

00:16:59.001 --> 00:17:01.503
"The prince is riding.

00:17:01.537 --> 00:17:04.538
I have heard the thunder
of his hooves.

00:17:04.573 --> 00:17:06.974
Swift as the wind he rides.

00:17:08.409 --> 00:17:11.278
His enemies
will cower before him...

00:17:12.746 --> 00:17:16.249
And their wives will
weep tears of blood."

00:17:19.988 --> 00:17:22.123
She's going
to have a boy.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.496
He won't be
a real Targaryen.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.932
He won't be
a true Dragon.

00:18:20.318 --> 00:18:23.287
<i>Vezh fin saja</i>
<i>rhaesheseres!</i>

00:18:23.321 --> 00:18:26.423
"The stallion
who mounts the world."

00:18:26.458 --> 00:18:29.460
The stallion is
the Khal of Khals.

00:18:29.494 --> 00:18:32.596
He shall unite the people
into a single Khalasar.

00:18:32.631 --> 00:18:35.999
<i>All the people of the world</i>
<i>will be his herd.</i>

00:18:36.034 --> 00:18:38.235
<i>...Rhaesheseres!</i>

00:18:38.269 --> 00:18:40.437
<i>Rhaesheseres!</i>

00:18:48.647 --> 00:18:51.148
Rhaego! Rhaego!

00:18:51.182 --> 00:18:53.317
Rhaego! Rhaego!

00:18:53.351 --> 00:18:56.119
Rhaego!
Rhaego...

00:19:02.259 --> 00:19:04.860
They love her.

00:19:07.463 --> 00:19:08.696
Rhaego! Rhaego!

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:11.466
Rhaego!
Rhaego...

00:19:28.852 --> 00:19:31.954
She truly is
a queen today.

00:20:00.248 --> 00:20:03.751
Don't let them see you
carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak.

00:20:03.785 --> 00:20:05.919
You know the law.

00:20:05.953 --> 00:20:07.921
It's not my law.

00:20:07.955 --> 00:20:09.924
They don't belong to you.

00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:12.360
Whatever is hers
is also mine.

00:20:13.262 --> 00:20:15.030
Once, perhaps.

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:19.802
If I sell one egg,
I'll have enough to buy a ship.

00:20:19.836 --> 00:20:22.004
Two eggs-- a ship
and an army.

00:20:22.039 --> 00:20:25.341
- And you have all three.
- I need a large army.

00:20:26.711 --> 00:20:29.513
I'm the last hope
of a dynasty, Mormont.

00:20:29.547 --> 00:20:31.682
The greatest dynasty
this world has ever seen

00:20:31.716 --> 00:20:34.218
on my shoulders since
I was five years old--

00:20:34.252 --> 00:20:37.254
and no one has ever given me
what they gave to her in that tent.

00:20:37.288 --> 00:20:39.156
Never.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.424
Not a piece of it.

00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:44.127
How can I carry
what I need to carry without it?

00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:45.862
Hmm?

00:20:45.896 --> 00:20:48.330
Who can rule without wealth
or fear or love?

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:56.573
Oh, you stand there,
all nobility and honor.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:02.446
You don't think I see you looking
at my little sister, hmm?

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.016
Don't think I know
what you want?

00:21:08.053 --> 00:21:10.956
I don't care.
You can have her.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.258
She can be Queen
of the savages and dine

00:21:13.293 --> 00:21:15.227
on the finest
bloody horseparts,

00:21:15.261 --> 00:21:18.063
and you can dine on whichever
parts of her you like.

00:21:19.398 --> 00:21:21.733
But let me go.

00:21:23.902 --> 00:21:25.403
You can go.

00:21:25.437 --> 00:21:27.271
You can't have the eggs.

00:21:27.305 --> 00:21:29.072
You swore
an oath to me.

00:21:29.107 --> 00:21:31.608
Does loyalty
mean nothing to you?

00:21:31.642 --> 00:21:33.810
It means everything to me.

00:21:33.844 --> 00:21:35.845
And yet here you stand.

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:37.980
And yet here I stand.

00:21:53.931 --> 00:21:56.533
Mord!

00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:58.801
Mord!

00:22:01.204 --> 00:22:03.072
Mord!

00:22:06.777 --> 00:22:08.811
Mord!

00:22:09.813 --> 00:22:11.614
Mord.

00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:14.650
Noise again!

00:22:17.054 --> 00:22:19.856
- About the gold...
- No gold!

00:22:19.891 --> 00:22:22.326
- No gold.
- Listen to me!

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.428
Listen to me.

00:22:24.462 --> 00:22:26.664
Sometimes possession

00:22:26.698 --> 00:22:28.800
is an abstract concept--

00:22:30.837 --> 00:22:33.372
When they captured me,
they took my purse,

00:22:33.406 --> 00:22:35.374
but the gold
is still mine.

00:22:35.408 --> 00:22:37.176
Where?

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.311
Where?
I don't know where,

00:22:39.345 --> 00:22:40.645
but when they free me--

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.080
You want free?

00:22:43.015 --> 00:22:45.350
Go be free.

00:22:46.618 --> 00:22:48.786
Have you ever
heard the phrase

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.754
"rich as a Lannister"?

00:22:53.358 --> 00:22:55.359
<i>Of course you have!</i>

00:22:55.393 --> 00:22:58.329
You're a smart man.

00:22:58.363 --> 00:23:01.199
You know who
the Lannisters are.

00:23:02.101 --> 00:23:05.069
I am a Lannister.

00:23:05.104 --> 00:23:08.773
Tyrion, son of Tywin!

00:23:08.808 --> 00:23:12.879
And of course,
you have also heard the phrase,

00:23:12.913 --> 00:23:16.249
"a Lannister always
pays his debts."

00:23:18.052 --> 00:23:20.620
If you deliver
a message from me...

00:23:21.722 --> 00:23:25.091
to Lady Arryn,
I will be in your debt.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.196
I will owe you gold.

00:23:30.565 --> 00:23:32.699
If you deliver
the message

00:23:32.734 --> 00:23:36.570
and I live, which I very much
intend to do.

00:23:39.207 --> 00:23:41.008
What message?

00:23:47.682 --> 00:23:50.317
Tell her I wish
to confess my crimes.

00:23:56.692 --> 00:23:59.727
You wish to confess
your crimes?

00:23:59.762 --> 00:24:01.396
Yes, My Lady.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:02.964
I do, My Lady.

00:24:02.998 --> 00:24:06.334
The sky cells
always break them.

00:24:06.369 --> 00:24:08.570
Speak, Imp.

00:24:08.605 --> 00:24:11.006
Meet your gods
as an honest man.

00:24:15.811 --> 00:24:19.448
Where do I begin,
my lords and ladies?

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.618
I'm a vile man,

00:24:22.652 --> 00:24:24.553
I confess it.

00:24:24.587 --> 00:24:27.589
My crimes and sins
are beyond counting.

00:24:27.624 --> 00:24:30.759
<i>I have lied</i>
<i>and cheated...</i>

00:24:32.094 --> 00:24:34.229
<i>gambled and whored.</i>

00:24:35.932 --> 00:24:37.900
<i>I'm not particularly</i>
<i>good at violence,</i>

00:24:37.934 --> 00:24:41.370
but I'm good at convincing
others to do violence for me.

00:24:44.008 --> 00:24:46.142
You want specifics,
I suppose.

00:24:47.545 --> 00:24:50.080
When I was seven
I saw a servant girl

00:24:50.114 --> 00:24:52.082
bathing in the river.

00:24:52.117 --> 00:24:53.984
I stole her robe.

00:24:54.018 --> 00:24:56.352
She was forced to return
to the castle

00:24:56.387 --> 00:24:58.387
naked and in tears.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.723
If I close my eyes,

00:25:01.758 --> 00:25:04.960
I can still see her tits bouncing.

00:25:07.229 --> 00:25:11.465
When I was 10 I stuffed
my Uncle's boots with goatshit.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.901
<i>When confronted</i>
<i>with my crime,</i>

00:25:13.935 --> 00:25:16.404
I blamed a squire.
Poor boy was flogged

00:25:16.438 --> 00:25:18.673
and I escaped justice.

00:25:18.707 --> 00:25:20.475
<i>When I was 12</i>

00:25:20.509 --> 00:25:23.511
I milked my eel
into a pot of turtle stew.

00:25:23.546 --> 00:25:26.582
I flogged the one-eyed snake.

00:25:26.616 --> 00:25:28.617
I skinned my sausage.

00:25:28.652 --> 00:25:31.854
I made the bald man cry

00:25:31.889 --> 00:25:33.890
<i>into the turtle stew,</i>

00:25:33.924 --> 00:25:35.925
which I do believe
my sister ate.

00:25:35.959 --> 00:25:37.894
<i>At least I hope she did.</i>

00:25:37.928 --> 00:25:40.262
Once I brought a jackass
and a honeycomb

00:25:40.297 --> 00:25:42.464
- into a brothel--
- Silence!

00:25:42.498 --> 00:25:44.099
What happened next?

00:25:45.101 --> 00:25:48.135
What do you think
you're doing?

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.104
Confessing my crimes.

00:25:50.138 --> 00:25:52.673
Lord Tyrion,
you are accused

00:25:52.707 --> 00:25:56.177
of hiring a man to slay
my son Bran in his bed,

00:25:56.211 --> 00:25:59.014
<i>and of conspiring to murder</i>
<i>my sister's husband</i>

00:25:59.048 --> 00:26:02.885
Lord Jon Arryn,
the Hand of the King.

00:26:02.919 --> 00:26:05.254
Oh, I'm very sorry.

00:26:06.423 --> 00:26:08.358
I don't know anything
about all that.

00:26:09.494 --> 00:26:11.729
You've had
your little joke.

00:26:11.763 --> 00:26:14.132
I trust you enjoyed it.

00:26:14.166 --> 00:26:17.035
Mord, take him back
to the dungeon.

00:26:17.069 --> 00:26:19.403
But this time find
a smaller cell...

00:26:19.438 --> 00:26:21.539
With a steeper floor.

00:26:21.574 --> 00:26:24.342
Is this how justice

00:26:24.376 --> 00:26:26.244
is done in the Vale?

00:26:26.278 --> 00:26:28.846
<i>You accuse me</i>
<i>of crimes,</i>

00:26:28.881 --> 00:26:32.049
I deny them,
so you throw me into a cell

00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:33.951
<i>to freeze and starve?</i>

00:26:33.985 --> 00:26:36.921
Where is
the King's Justice?

00:26:36.955 --> 00:26:40.325
I am accused
and demand a trial!

00:26:42.061 --> 00:26:43.996
If you're tried
and found guilty,

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:47.133
then by the King's own laws
you will pay with your life.

00:26:47.167 --> 00:26:50.270
I understand the law.

00:26:50.304 --> 00:26:52.872
We have no executioner
in the Eyrie.

00:26:52.907 --> 00:26:55.709
Life is more elegant here.

00:26:55.743 --> 00:26:57.677
Open the moon door.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.299
<i>You want a trial,</i>
<i>My Lord Lannister.</i>

00:27:21.333 --> 00:27:23.334
Very well.

00:27:23.369 --> 00:27:26.337
My son will listen
to whatever you have to say,

00:27:26.372 --> 00:27:28.639
and you will hear
his judgment.

00:27:28.674 --> 00:27:30.775
Then you will leave...

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.944
By one door
or the other.

00:27:32.978 --> 00:27:36.180
No need to bother
Lord Robin.

00:27:36.215 --> 00:27:39.851
I demand a trial by combat.

00:27:48.494 --> 00:27:50.361
You have that right.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.331
My Lady, I beg the honor.

00:27:53.365 --> 00:27:55.333
Let me be your champion.

00:27:55.367 --> 00:27:57.768
The honor should be mine.

00:27:57.803 --> 00:28:00.037
For the love I bore
your Lord husband,

00:28:00.072 --> 00:28:01.873
let me avenge his death.

00:28:01.907 --> 00:28:04.442
- <i>I'll fight for you, My Lady.</i>
- It'll be my honor.

00:28:04.476 --> 00:28:07.811
- The honor should be mine.
- Make the bad man fly!

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.782
Ser Vardis...

00:28:11.817 --> 00:28:13.985
You're quiet.

00:28:14.019 --> 00:28:15.919
Don't you want
to avenge my husband?

00:28:17.922 --> 00:28:20.491
With all my heart,
My Lady.

00:28:20.525 --> 00:28:22.459
But the Imp
is half my size.

00:28:22.494 --> 00:28:25.628
It would be shameful to slaughter
such a man and call it justice.

00:28:25.663 --> 00:28:27.731
Agreed.

00:28:27.765 --> 00:28:30.700
You demanded
a trial by combat.

00:28:30.735 --> 00:28:34.070
Now I demand a champion.
I have that right, same as you.

00:28:34.105 --> 00:28:36.072
My Lady,

00:28:36.106 --> 00:28:39.576
I will gladly fight
the Imp's champion for you.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.112
I wouldn't be
too glad, Ser.

00:28:42.146 --> 00:28:44.648
I name my brother
Jaime Lannister.

00:28:44.682 --> 00:28:46.883
<i>The Kingslayer</i>

00:28:46.918 --> 00:28:48.885
is hundreds of miles
from here.

00:28:48.919 --> 00:28:51.521
Send a raven for him.
I'm happy to wait.

00:28:52.423 --> 00:28:54.591
The trial will be today.

00:28:57.529 --> 00:29:00.097
Do I have a volunteer?

00:29:07.907 --> 00:29:10.475
Anyone?

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:12.511
Anyone?

00:29:15.448 --> 00:29:17.749
I think we can assume
that no one is willing--

00:29:17.783 --> 00:29:19.818
I'll stand
for the dwarf.

00:29:31.296 --> 00:29:33.430
More wine, Your Grace?

00:29:35.333 --> 00:29:37.868
- What was I saying?
- Renly: Simpler time.

00:29:37.903 --> 00:29:41.239
It was! It was.
You're too young to remember.

00:29:41.273 --> 00:29:42.974
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

00:29:43.009 --> 00:29:46.478
- It was, Your Grace.
- The enemy was right  in the open,

00:29:46.513 --> 00:29:50.716
vicious as you like, all but
sending you a bloody invitation.

00:29:50.751 --> 00:29:52.719
Nothing like today.

00:29:52.753 --> 00:29:55.621
- It sounds exhilarating.
- Exhilarating, yes.

00:29:55.655 --> 00:29:58.023
Not as exhilarating
as those balls

00:29:58.058 --> 00:30:00.459
and masquerades
you like to throw.

00:30:05.398 --> 00:30:07.865
You ever fuck
a Riverlands girl?

00:30:07.899 --> 00:30:09.533
Once.
I think.

00:30:09.567 --> 00:30:13.370
You think?
I think you'd remember.

00:30:13.404 --> 00:30:16.339
Back in our day,
you weren't a real man

00:30:16.374 --> 00:30:19.476
until you'd fucked one girl
from each of the Seven Kingdoms

00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:21.245
and the Riverlands.

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:24.515
- We used to call it "making the eight."
- Those were some <i>lucky</i> girls.

00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:26.584
You ever make
the eight, Barristan?

00:30:26.618 --> 00:30:28.586
I don't believe so,
Your Grace.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.488
Those were the days.

00:30:30.522 --> 00:30:32.290
Which days, exactly?

00:30:32.324 --> 00:30:35.827
The ones where half of Westeros
fought the other half and millions died?

00:30:35.861 --> 00:30:39.097
Or before that, when the Mad King
slaughtered women and babies

00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:42.033
because the voices in his head
told him they deserved it?

00:30:42.067 --> 00:30:45.436
Or way before that, when dragons
burned whole cities to the ground?

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.638
Easy, boy.

00:30:47.673 --> 00:30:50.641
You might be my brother,
but you're speaking to the King.

00:30:50.676 --> 00:30:52.410
I suppose it was all
rather heroic...

00:30:52.444 --> 00:30:55.279
If you were drunk enough
and had some poor Riverlands whore

00:30:55.313 --> 00:30:57.948
to shove your prick inside
and make the eight.

00:31:02.054 --> 00:31:03.922
More wine, Your Grace?

00:31:19.974 --> 00:31:23.810
<i>They burned most everything</i>
<i>in the Riverlands:</i>

00:31:23.845 --> 00:31:28.014
<i>Our fields;</i>
<i>Our granaries;</i>

00:31:28.048 --> 00:31:30.450
our homes.

00:31:30.484 --> 00:31:34.620
<i>They took our women,</i>
<i>then they took 'em again.</i>

00:31:34.655 --> 00:31:37.256
When they was done,
they butchered them

00:31:37.291 --> 00:31:39.092
as if they was animals.

00:31:39.126 --> 00:31:41.261
They covered our children

00:31:41.296 --> 00:31:43.097
in pitch

00:31:43.131 --> 00:31:45.032
and lit them on fire.

00:31:46.201 --> 00:31:48.202
Brigands, most likely.

00:31:48.237 --> 00:31:50.606
They weren't thieves.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.242
They didn't steal
nothing.

00:31:53.276 --> 00:31:56.678
They even left something behind,
Your Grace.

00:31:56.713 --> 00:32:00.115
It's the King's Hand
you're addressing, not the King.

00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:02.083
The King is hunting.

00:32:09.157 --> 00:32:13.394
Fish.
The Sigil of House Tully.

00:32:13.428 --> 00:32:17.198
Isn't that your wife's house--
Tully, My Lord Hand?

00:32:21.836 --> 00:32:25.272
These men,
were they flying a Sigil?

00:32:26.308 --> 00:32:29.076
- A banner?
- None, your--

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.711
Hand.

00:32:30.745 --> 00:32:32.579
<i>The one who was</i>
<i>leading them...</i>

00:32:32.614 --> 00:32:36.117
Taller by a foot
than any man I've ever met,

00:32:36.151 --> 00:32:39.487
saw him cut
the blacksmith in two,

00:32:39.521 --> 00:32:41.922
saw him take the head
off a horse

00:32:41.957 --> 00:32:44.459
with a single swing
of his sword.

00:32:44.493 --> 00:32:47.028
That sounds like
someone we know.

00:32:47.062 --> 00:32:49.164
The Mountain.

00:32:49.198 --> 00:32:52.267
You're describing
Ser Gregor Clegane.

00:32:52.301 --> 00:32:55.270
Why should Ser Gregor
turn brigand?

00:32:55.304 --> 00:32:57.471
The man is
an anointed knight.

00:32:57.506 --> 00:33:00.574
I've heard him called
Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

00:33:00.608 --> 00:33:02.844
I'm sure you have
as well.

00:33:02.878 --> 00:33:04.879
Can you think
of any reason

00:33:04.913 --> 00:33:06.714
the Lannisters
might possibly have

00:33:06.748 --> 00:33:08.416
for being angry
with your wife?

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.218
Maester Pycelle:
<i>If the Lannisters</i>

00:33:11.253 --> 00:33:13.554
were to order attacks
on villages

00:33:13.588 --> 00:33:15.823
under the King's
protection,

00:33:15.857 --> 00:33:18.626
- it would be--
- That would be almost as brazen

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.695
as attacking the Hand of the King
in the streets of the capital.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:24.132
Well...

00:33:27.904 --> 00:33:30.272
I cannot give you
back your homes

00:33:30.306 --> 00:33:33.008
<i>or restore</i>
<i>your dead to life,</i>

00:33:33.043 --> 00:33:35.010
but perhaps I can
give you justice

00:33:35.045 --> 00:33:37.679
<i>in the name of our King,</i>
<i>Robert.</i>

00:33:37.714 --> 00:33:41.049
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

00:33:45.087 --> 00:33:48.790
You shall have the command.
Assemble 100 men

00:33:48.824 --> 00:33:52.527
- and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
- As you command.

00:33:59.601 --> 00:34:02.737
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

00:34:02.762 --> 00:34:02.771
the first of his name,

00:34:02.772 --> 00:34:06.642
King of the Andals and the first men,
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

00:34:06.676 --> 00:34:08.911
and protector of the realm,

00:34:08.946 --> 00:34:11.180
I charge you to bring
the King's Justice

00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:13.250
to the false knight
Gregor Clegane

00:34:13.284 --> 00:34:15.752
and all those
who shared in his crimes.

00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:17.688
I denounce him

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:19.690
and attaint him.

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:23.026
I strip him of all
ranks and titles,

00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:26.729
<i>of all lands and holdings,</i>

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:30.133
- and sentence him to death.
- My Lord...

00:34:30.167 --> 00:34:33.135
This-- this is
a drastic action.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.938
It would be better to wait
for King Robert's return.

00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:38.407
- Grand Maester Pycelle.
- My Lord.

00:34:38.442 --> 00:34:40.811
Send a raven
to Casterly Rock.

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:44.181
Inform Tywin Lannister that
he has been summoned to court

00:34:44.216 --> 00:34:46.283
<i>to answer for the crimes</i>
<i>of his bannermen.</i>

00:34:46.318 --> 00:34:50.454
He will arrive within the fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown

00:34:50.488 --> 00:34:54.158
and a traitor
to the realm.

00:35:07.273 --> 00:35:10.142
A bold move, My Lord,
and admirable.

00:35:10.176 --> 00:35:12.711
But is it wise
to yank the lion's tail?

00:35:12.746 --> 00:35:16.248
Tywin Lannister is the richest man
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:20.319
Gold wins wars,
not soldiers.

00:35:20.353 --> 00:35:22.688
Then how come
Robert is King

00:35:22.722 --> 00:35:25.024
and not Tywin Lannister?

00:35:57.458 --> 00:36:01.061
<i>Hold!</i>

00:36:01.095 --> 00:36:03.331
<i>- Attack attack!</i>
<i>- Come on, Ser Vardis!</i>

00:36:03.365 --> 00:36:06.334
<i>Attack!</i>

00:36:09.571 --> 00:36:12.139
Stand and fight, coward!

00:37:12.569 --> 00:37:15.204
Yes!

00:37:17.207 --> 00:37:20.877
Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.

00:37:39.431 --> 00:37:42.199
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Get up!</i>

00:37:42.234 --> 00:37:45.302
<i>Get up, get up,</i>
<i>get up!</i>

00:37:47.338 --> 00:37:49.540
<i>Raise your sword.</i>
<i>Raise it!</i>

00:37:52.844 --> 00:37:54.445
Get up, man!

00:37:54.479 --> 00:37:56.180
- <i>On your feet!</i>
- <i>Get up!</i>

00:37:56.214 --> 00:37:58.849
<i>Get up and fight,</i>
<i>Ser Vardis!</i>

00:38:12.796 --> 00:38:15.631
<i>No! Have mercy!</i>

00:38:40.258 --> 00:38:42.460
Is it over?

00:38:46.531 --> 00:38:49.533
You don't fight
with honor!

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:53.804
No.

00:38:56.474 --> 00:38:57.741
He did.

00:39:11.656 --> 00:39:13.523
Can I make
the little man fly now?

00:39:13.558 --> 00:39:15.492
Not this little man.

00:39:15.526 --> 00:39:17.894
This little man
is going home.

00:39:19.998 --> 00:39:21.998
I believe you have
something of mine.

00:39:41.953 --> 00:39:44.822
A Lannister always
pays his debts.

00:40:02.107 --> 00:40:02.173
You wear your hair like
a real southern lady now.

00:40:06.512 --> 00:40:09.647
Well, why shouldn't I?
We're in the South.

00:40:09.682 --> 00:40:13.018
It's important to remember where
you come from.

00:40:13.052 --> 00:40:16.288
I'm not sure your mother would
like these new styles.

00:40:16.322 --> 00:40:19.025
My mother isn't
<i>from</i> the North.

00:40:20.394 --> 00:40:22.228
I'm aware of that.

00:40:22.262 --> 00:40:24.063
Why do you care?

00:40:24.097 --> 00:40:25.765
Do you even have hair
under there?

00:40:25.799 --> 00:40:29.234
Yes.
I have hair.

00:40:29.269 --> 00:40:31.037
I've never seen it.

00:40:31.071 --> 00:40:33.205
Would you like to?

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.275
No.

00:40:37.178 --> 00:40:39.846
Where are you from anyway?
The North or the South?

00:40:41.682 --> 00:40:44.250
I come from a very
small village in--

00:40:44.285 --> 00:40:45.552
Oh, wait.

00:40:45.586 --> 00:40:48.021
I just realized
I don't care.

00:40:48.055 --> 00:40:50.290
- Sansa--
- Septa.

00:40:50.324 --> 00:40:53.760
Now you are being rude.

00:40:59.466 --> 00:41:01.601
My prince.

00:41:03.905 --> 00:41:05.872
My prince.

00:41:05.907 --> 00:41:07.507
My Lady.

00:41:08.743 --> 00:41:11.077
I fear I have
behaved monstrously

00:41:11.112 --> 00:41:13.980
the past few weeks.

00:41:16.049 --> 00:41:18.150
With your permission?

00:41:30.562 --> 00:41:33.230
It's beautiful,

00:41:33.265 --> 00:41:35.332
like the one
your mother wears.

00:41:35.367 --> 00:41:37.334
You'll be queen someday.

00:41:37.368 --> 00:41:40.170
It's only fitting
you should look the part.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.345
Will you forgive me
for my rudeness?

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.316
There's nothing to forgive.

00:41:52.019 --> 00:41:54.721
You're My Lady.

00:41:54.755 --> 00:41:57.924
One day we'll be married
in the throne room.

00:41:57.958 --> 00:42:01.894
Lords and ladies from all over
the Seven Kingdoms will come,

00:42:01.928 --> 00:42:04.196
from the last hearth
in the North

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:07.166
to the Salt Shore
in the South,

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.436
and you will be Queen
over all of them.

00:42:13.673 --> 00:42:16.107
<i>I'll never</i>
<i>disrespect you again.</i>

00:42:16.142 --> 00:42:19.344
I'll never be cruel
to you again.

00:42:19.378 --> 00:42:21.680
Do you understand me?

00:42:23.516 --> 00:42:25.751
You're My Lady now,

00:42:25.785 --> 00:42:29.221
from this day

00:42:29.255 --> 00:42:32.024
until my last day.

00:42:54.115 --> 00:42:56.216
Stop.

00:42:56.251 --> 00:42:58.819
- Stop!
- Whoa.

00:43:00.221 --> 00:43:02.755
- What are you doing?
- Going to King's Landing.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.891
In a turnip cart?

00:43:04.925 --> 00:43:07.927
I'll find a ship heading
south in White Harbor.

00:43:08.995 --> 00:43:10.796
And you can afford that?

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:13.531
Some of my friends are more
generous than others.

00:43:13.566 --> 00:43:16.234
There's a thousand
girls like you in King's Landing.

00:43:16.269 --> 00:43:18.536
So I'll have
lots of company.

00:43:18.571 --> 00:43:20.272
Yes, you'll be
very popular...

00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:22.007
Until some fat lord
comes to visit

00:43:22.042 --> 00:43:23.909
with a big belly
and a little prick

00:43:23.944 --> 00:43:26.446
and he can't get it up
so he knocks all your teeth out.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.349
And what will happen
to me if I stay here?

00:43:29.383 --> 00:43:31.318
Will I become
Lady Greyjoy,

00:43:31.352 --> 00:43:34.422
- mistress of the Iron Islands?
- Don't be a fool.

00:43:34.456 --> 00:43:36.590
I hear Jaime Lannister
attacked Lord Stark

00:43:36.625 --> 00:43:38.392
in the streets
of King's Landing.

00:43:38.427 --> 00:43:42.296
Every man for a hundred miles will be
marching off to war soon

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:44.297
and most of them
will never come back.

00:43:44.332 --> 00:43:46.333
There's nothing left
for me here.

00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:49.669
Let's go, Stefon.

00:43:49.703 --> 00:43:51.170
<i>Giddyup.</i>

00:43:51.204 --> 00:43:53.472
Let me see it
one more time!

00:43:53.506 --> 00:43:55.807
See what?

00:44:07.219 --> 00:44:09.320
I'm going to miss you.

00:44:09.355 --> 00:44:11.222
I know.

00:44:25.002 --> 00:44:27.037
I'm sending you both
back to Winterfell.

00:44:27.071 --> 00:44:28.471
- What?!
- Listen--

00:44:28.505 --> 00:44:31.107
- What about Joffrey?
- Are you dying because of your leg?

00:44:31.141 --> 00:44:32.420
<i>Is that why</i>
<i>you're sending us home?</i>

00:44:32.445 --> 00:44:33.609
What? No.

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:35.044
Please, father.
Please don't.

00:44:35.078 --> 00:44:37.246
You can't.
I've got my lessons with Syrio.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.881
I'm finally
getting good.

00:44:38.915 --> 00:44:41.350
This isn't
a punishment.

00:44:41.384 --> 00:44:43.786
I want you back in Winterfell
for your own safety.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.254
Can we take Syrio
back with us?

00:44:45.289 --> 00:44:46.860
Who cares about your
stupid dancing teacher?

00:44:46.885 --> 00:44:48.185
I can't go.

00:44:48.192 --> 00:44:50.060
I'm supposed to marry
Prince Joffrey.

00:44:50.094 --> 00:44:51.996
I love him and I'm meant
to be his Queen

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:54.632
- and have his babies.
- Seven hells.

00:44:54.666 --> 00:44:56.300
When you're old enough,

00:44:56.334 --> 00:44:59.036
I'll make you a match
with someone who's worthy of you,

00:44:59.071 --> 00:45:01.739
someone who's brave
and gentle and strong--

00:45:01.773 --> 00:45:05.043
I don't want someone brave
and gentle and strong. I want him!

00:45:05.077 --> 00:45:07.846
He'll be the greatest
King that ever was, a golden lion,

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.648
and I'll give him
sons with beautiful blond hair.

00:45:10.683 --> 00:45:13.318
<i>The lion'sot</i>
<i>s Sigil, idiot.</i>

00:45:13.352 --> 00:45:15.153
He's a stag,
like his father.

00:45:15.187 --> 00:45:18.089
He is not.
He's nothing like that old drunk King.

00:45:21.293 --> 00:45:24.129
Go on, girls. Get your Septa and start
packing your things.

00:45:24.163 --> 00:45:25.665
- Wait!
- Come on.

00:45:25.699 --> 00:45:27.333
But it's not fair!

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:04.773
"Lord Orys Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:09.679
"Axel Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:46:10.781 --> 00:46:13.583
"Lyonel Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:46:14.953 --> 00:46:17.721
"Steffon Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.761
"Robert Baratheon,
black of hair."

00:46:27.764 --> 00:46:29.965
"Joffrey Baratheon...

00:46:31.033 --> 00:46:33.134
Golden-haired."

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.602
Daenerys!

00:47:08.939 --> 00:47:10.873
Where's my sister?

00:47:10.908 --> 00:47:12.075
Stop him.

00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:13.643
<i>Where is she?</i>

00:47:13.678 --> 00:47:15.812
<i>Hmm?</i>

00:47:18.282 --> 00:47:21.050
Where is she?
I'm here for the feast.

00:47:22.119 --> 00:47:24.387
- The whore's feast?
- Come.

00:47:24.421 --> 00:47:26.088
Get your hands off me!

00:47:26.122 --> 00:47:28.657
No one touches
the Dragon!

00:47:29.525 --> 00:47:31.693
<i>Khal rhae mhar!</i>

00:47:31.727 --> 00:47:34.495
Me ifa!

00:47:37.133 --> 00:47:39.601
Khal Drogo!

00:47:39.636 --> 00:47:42.104
I'm here for the feast.

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:46.910
<i>Nevakhi vekha ha maan.</i>

00:47:46.944 --> 00:47:49.312
Khal Drogo says
there is a place for you.

00:47:49.347 --> 00:47:51.548
Back there.

00:47:53.785 --> 00:47:56.020
That is no place
for a King.

00:47:56.054 --> 00:47:58.722
You are no King.

00:48:00.958 --> 00:48:03.125
Keep away from me!

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.161
Viserys, please.

00:48:07.297 --> 00:48:09.198
There she is.

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:16.404
Put the sword down.
They'll kill us all.

00:48:16.439 --> 00:48:19.074
They can't kill us.

00:48:20.409 --> 00:48:23.111
They can't shed blood
in their sacred city.

00:48:30.187 --> 00:48:31.621
But I can.

00:48:41.365 --> 00:48:43.800
I want what I came for.

00:48:43.834 --> 00:48:46.236
I want the crown
he promised me.

00:48:47.104 --> 00:48:49.005
He bought you.

00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:51.173
But he never
paid for you.

00:48:56.379 --> 00:48:59.448
Tell him I want what was bargained
for or I'm taking you back.

00:49:00.517 --> 00:49:03.119
He can keep the baby.

00:49:03.153 --> 00:49:05.454
I'll cut it out
and leave it for him.

00:49:08.692 --> 00:49:11.928
<i>Anha vazhak maan</i>
<i>rek me zala.</i>

00:49:13.364 --> 00:49:16.700
<i>Anha vazhak maan</i>
<i>firikhnharen hoshora</i>

00:49:16.734 --> 00:49:19.469
<i>ma mahrazhi aqovi</i>
<i>affin mori atihi mae!</i>

00:49:19.503 --> 00:49:21.938
What's he saying?

00:49:23.373 --> 00:49:25.107
He says yes.

00:49:26.543 --> 00:49:29.444
You shall have
a golden crown...

00:49:31.081 --> 00:49:33.649
That men shall tremble
to behold.

00:49:44.794 --> 00:49:46.995
That was all I wanted.

00:49:49.364 --> 00:49:51.499
What-what was promised.

00:50:07.983 --> 00:50:09.950
<i>Qora mae.</i>

00:50:11.219 --> 00:50:13.253
No!

00:50:13.288 --> 00:50:15.990
No!
You cannot touch me.

00:50:16.024 --> 00:50:18.359
I am the Dragon.
I am the Dragon!

00:50:18.393 --> 00:50:21.162
I want my crown!
Ahh!

00:50:21.197 --> 00:50:24.366
<i>Ammeni haz jolin!</i>

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:35.712
- Look away, Khaleesi.
- No.

00:50:42.686 --> 00:50:45.054
<i>No, dany.</i>

00:50:45.088 --> 00:50:46.555
Dany, tell them.

00:50:46.589 --> 00:50:48.023
Make them!

00:50:49.025 --> 00:50:51.794
<i>Dany, make them...</i>

00:50:53.463 --> 00:50:55.564
No, you can't!

00:50:55.598 --> 00:50:58.734
Just-- please!

00:50:58.768 --> 00:51:01.703
Dany, please!

00:51:03.306 --> 00:51:05.808
A crown for a King.

00:51:20.791 --> 00:51:23.159
Khaleesi?

00:51:23.193 --> 00:51:25.395
He was no Dragon.

00:51:26.564 --> 00:51:29.200
Fire cannot kill a Dragon.
